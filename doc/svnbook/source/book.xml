  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>A bad Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet is one that is
    composed not of the questions people actually ask, but of the
    questions the FAQ's author <emphasis>wishes</emphasis> people
    would ask.  Perhaps you've seen the type before:</para>

  <blockquote>
    <para>Q: How can I use Glorbosoft XYZ to maximize team
      productivity?</para>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <para>A: Many of our customers want to know how they can
      maximize productivity through our patented office groupware
      innovations.  The answer is simple.  First, click on the
      <literal>File</literal> menu, scroll down to
      <literal>Increase&#xA0;Productivity</literal>,
      then&#x2026;</para>
  </blockquote>

  <para>The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a
    literal sense, FAQs at all.  No one ever called the tech support
    line and asked, <quote>How can we maximize
    productivity?</quote>  Rather, people asked highly specific
    questions, such as <quote>How can we change the calendaring system
    to send reminders two days in advance instead of one?</quote>
    and so on.  But it's a lot easier to make up imaginary
    Frequently Asked Questions than it is to discover the real ones.
    Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, organized
    effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions
    must be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a
    coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective
    experience of users in the wild.  It calls for the patient,
    observant attitude of a field naturalist.  No grand
    hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here&#x2014;open eyes
    and accurate note-taking are what's needed most.</para>

  <para>What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such
    a process, and shows it on every page.  It is the direct result
    of the authors' encounters with users.  It began with Ben
    Collins-Sussman's observation that people were asking the same
    basic questions over and over on the Subversion mailing lists:
    what are the standard workflows to use with Subversion?  Do
    branches and tags work the same way as in other version control
    systems?  How can I find out who made a particular change?</para>

  <para>Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben
    worked intensely over a month in the summer of 2002 to write
    <citetitle>The Subversion Handbook</citetitle>, a 60-page
    manual that covered all the basics of using Subversion.  The
    manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was
    distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump
    in the learning curve.  When O'Reilly decided to
    publish a full-length Subversion book, the path of least
    resistance was obvious: just expand the Subversion
    handbook.</para>

  <para>The three coauthors of the new book were thus presented
    with an unusual opportunity.  Officially, their task was to
    write a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an
    initial draft.  But they also had access to a steady
    stream&#x2014;indeed, an uncontrollable geyser&#x2014;of bottom-up
    source material.  Subversion was already in the hands of
    thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of
    feedback, not only about Subversion, but also about its existing
    documentation.</para>

  <para>During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and
    Brian haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms
    incessantly, carefully noting the problems users were having in
    real-life situations.  Monitoring such feedback was part of their
    job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge
    advantage when they set out to document Subversion.  The book
    they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience,
    not in the shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the
    best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet.  This duality might
    not be noticeable on a first reading.  Taken in order, front to
    back, the book is simply a straightforward description of a
    piece of software.  There's the overview, the obligatory guided
    tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced
    topics, and of course, a command reference and troubleshooting
    guide.  Only when you come back to it later, seeking the
    solution to some specific problem, does its authenticity shine
    out: the telling details that can only result from encounters
    with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine use cases,
    and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the
    user's point of view.</para>

  <para>Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer
    every question you have about Subversion.  Sometimes the
    precision with which it anticipates your questions will seem
    eerily telepathic; yet occasionally, you will stumble into a
    hole in the community's knowledge and come away empty-handed.
    When this happens, the best thing you can do is email
    <email>users@subversion.tigris.org</email> and present your
    problem.  The authors are still there and still watching, and the
    authors include not just the three listed on the cover, but many others
    who contributed corrections and original material.  From the
    community's point of view, solving your problem is merely a
    pleasant side effect of a much larger project&#x2014;namely,
    slowly adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion itself, to
    more closely match the way people actually use it.  They are
    eager to hear from you, not only because they can help you, but
    because you can help them.  With Subversion, as with all active
    free software projects, <emphasis>you are not
    alone</emphasis>.</para>

      <primary>Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</primary>
    </indexterm>

    In the world of open source software, the Concurrent Versions
    System (CVS) was the tool of choice for version control for many
    years.  And rightly so.  CVS was open source software itself, and
    its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked
    operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers
    to share their work.  It fit the collaborative nature of the
    open source world very well.  CVS and its semi-chaotic development
    model have since become cornerstones of open source
    culture.</para>

  <para>But CVS was not without its flaws, and simply fixing those
    flaws promised to be an enormous effort.  Enter Subversion.
    Subversion was designed to be a successor to CVS, and its originators set
    out to win the hearts of CVS users in two ways&#x2014;by creating
    an open source system with a design (and <quote>look and
    feel</quote>) similar to CVS, and by attempting to avoid most of
    CVS's noticeable flaws.  While the result isn't necessarily the
    next great evolution in version control design, Subversion
    <emphasis>is</emphasis> very powerful, very usable, and very
    flexible.  And for the most part, almost all newly started
    open source projects now choose Subversion instead of CVS.</para>

  <para>This book is written to document the 1.6 series of the
    Subversion version control system.  We have made every attempt to
    be thorough in our coverage.  However, Subversion has a thriving
    and energetic development community, so already a number
    of features and improvements are planned for future versions that may
    change some of the commands and specific notes in this
    book.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.preface.audience">

    <title>Audience</title>
    
    <para>This book is written for computer-literate folk who want to
      use Subversion to manage their data.  While Subversion runs on a
      number of different operating systems, its primary user
      interface is command-line-based.  That command-line tool
      (<command>svn</command>), and some auxiliary programs, are the
      focus of this book.</para>

    <para>For consistency, the examples in this book assume that the reader
      is using a Unix-like operating system and is relatively comfortable
      with Unix and command-line interfaces.  That said, the
      <command>svn</command> program also runs on non-Unix platforms
      such as Microsoft Windows.  With a few minor exceptions, such as
      the use of backward slashes (<literal>\</literal>) instead of
      forward slashes (<literal>/</literal>) for path separators, the
      input to and output from this tool when run on Windows are
      identical to its Unix counterpart.</para>

    <para>Most readers are probably programmers or system
      administrators who need to track changes to source code.  This
      is the most common use for Subversion, and therefore it is the
      scenario underlying all of the book's examples.  But Subversion
      can be used to manage changes to any sort of
      information&#x2014;images, music, databases, documentation, and
      so on.  To Subversion, all data is just data.</para>
    
    <para>While this book is written with the assumption that the
      reader has never used a version control system, we've also tried
      to make it easy for users of CVS (and other systems) to make a
      painless leap into Subversion.  Special sidebars may mention
      other version control systems from time to time, and Appendix B
      summarizes many of the differences between CVS and
      Subversion.</para>

    <para>Note also that the source code examples used throughout the
      book are only examples.  While they will compile with the proper
      compiler incantations, they are intended to illustrate a
      particular scenario and not necessarily to serve as examples of good
      programming style or practices.</para>

    <title>How to Read This Book</title>

    <para>Technical books always face a certain dilemma: whether to
      cater to <firstterm>top-down</firstterm>
      or to <firstterm>bottom-up</firstterm> learners.  A top-down
      learner prefers to read or skim documentation, getting a large
      overview of how the system works; only then does she actually
      start using the software.  A bottom-up learner is a <quote>learn by
      doing</quote> person&#x2014;someone who just wants to dive into the
      software and figure it out as she goes, referring to book
      sections when necessary.  Most books tend to be written for one
      type of person or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased
      toward top-down learners.  (And if you're actually reading this
      section, you're probably already a top-down learner yourself!)
      However, if you're a bottom-up person, don't despair.  While the
      book may be laid out as a broad survey of Subversion topics, the
      content of each section tends to be heavy with specific
      examples that you can try-by-doing.  For the impatient folks who
      just want to get going, you can jump right to
      <xref linkend="svn.intro"/>.</para>

    <para>Regardless of your learning style, this book aims to be
      useful to people of widely different backgrounds&#x2014;from
      those with no previous experience in version control to
      experienced system administrators.  Depending on your own
      background, certain chapters may be more or less important to
      you.  The following can be considered a
      <quote>recommended reading list</quote> for various types of
      readers:</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Experienced system administrators</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The assumption here is that you've probably used
            version control before and are dying to get a
            Subversion server up and running ASAP.
            <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin"/> and
            <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/> will show you how to
            create your first repository and make it available over
            the network.  After that's done,
            <xref linkend="svn.tour"/> and
            <xref linkend="svn.forcvs"/> are the fastest routes to
            learning the Subversion client.</para>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>New users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Your administrator has probably set up Subversion
            already, and you need to learn how to use the client.  If
            you've never used a version control system, then
            <xref linkend="svn.basic"/> is a vital introduction to the
            ideas behind version control.  <xref linkend="svn.tour"/>
            is a guided tour of the Subversion client.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Advanced users</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Whether you're a user or administrator, eventually
            your project will grow larger.  You're going to want to
            learn how to do more advanced things with Subversion, such
            as how to use Subversion's property support
            (<xref linkend="svn.advanced"/>), how to use branches and
            perform merges (<xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>), how to
            configure runtime options
            (<xref linkend="svn.customization"/>), and other things.
            These chapters aren't critical at first, but be sure to
            read them once you're comfortable with the basics.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>Developers</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Presumably, you're already familiar with Subversion,
            and now want to either extend it or build new software on
            top of its many APIs.  <xref linkend="svn.developer"/> is
            just for you.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The book ends with reference material&#x2014;<xref linkend="svn.ref"/> is a reference guide for all Subversion
      commands, and the appendixes cover a number of useful topics.
      These are the chapters you're mostly likely to come back to
      after you've finished the book.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.intro.whatis">

    <title>What Is Subversion?</title>
      
    <para>Subversion is a free/open source version control system.
      That is, Subversion manages files and directories, and the
      changes made to them, over time.  This allows you to recover
      older versions of your data or examine the history of how your
      data changed.  In this regard, many people think of a version
      control system as a sort of <quote>time machine.</quote></para>
    
    <para>Subversion can operate across networks, which allows it to
      be used by people on different computers.  At some level, the
      ability for various people to modify and manage the same set of
      data from their respective locations fosters collaboration.
      Progress can occur more quickly without a single conduit through
      which all modifications must occur.  And because the work is
      versioned, you need not fear that quality is the trade-off for
      losing that conduit&#x2014;if some incorrect change is made to
      the data, just undo that change.</para>

    <para>Some version control systems are also software configuration
      management (SCM) systems.  These systems are specifically
      tailored to manage trees of source code and have many features
      that are specific to software development&#x2014;such as natively
      understanding programming languages, or supplying tools for
      building software.  Subversion, however, is not one of these
      systems.  It is a general system that can be used to manage
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> collection of files.  For you, those
      files might be source code&#x2014;for others, anything from
      grocery shopping lists to digital video mixdowns and
      beyond.</para>


    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.intro.righttool">
  
      <title>Is Subversion the Right Tool?</title>
  
      <para>If you're a user or system administrator pondering the use
        of Subversion, the first question you should ask yourself is:
        "Is this the right tool for the job?"  Subversion is a
        fantastic hammer, but be careful not to view every problem as
        a nail.</para>

      <para>If you need to archive old versions of files and
        directories, possibly resurrect them, or examine logs of how
        they've changed over time, then Subversion is exactly the
        right tool for you.  If you need to collaborate with people on
        documents (usually over a network) and keep track of who made
        which changes, then Subversion is also appropriate.  This is
        why Subversion is so often used in software development
        environments&#x2014; working on a development team is an inherently social
        activity, and Subversion makes it easy to collaborate with
        other programmers.  Of course, there's a cost to using
        Subversion as well: administrative overhead.  You'll need to
        manage a data repository to store the information and all its
        history, and be diligent about backing it up.  When working
        with the data on a daily basis, you won't be able to copy,
        move, rename, or delete files the way you usually do.
        Instead, you'll have to do all of those things through
        Subversion.</para>

      <para>Assuming you're fine with the extra workflow, you should
        still make sure you're not using Subversion to solve a problem
        that other tools solve better.  For example, because
        Subversion replicates data to all the collaborators involved,
        a common misuse is to treat it as a generic distribution
        system.  People will sometimes use Subversion to distribute
        huge collections of photos, digital music, or software
        packages.  The problem is that this sort of data usually isn't
        changing at all.  The collection itself grows over time, but
        the individual files within the collection aren't being
        changed.  In this case, using Subversion
        is <quote>overkill.</quote>
        <footnote>
          <para>Or as a friend puts it, <quote>swatting a fly with a
            Buick.</quote></para>
        </footnote> 
        There are simpler tools that
        efficiently replicate data <emphasis>without</emphasis> the
        overhead of tracking changes, such as <command>rsync</command>

        In early 2000, CollabNet, Inc. (<ulink url="http://www.collab.net"/>) began seeking developers to
        write a replacement for CVS.  CollabNet offers a collaboration
        software suite called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE), of
        which one component is version control.  Although CEE used CVS
        as its initial version control system, CVS's limitations were
        obvious from the beginning, and CollabNet knew it would
        eventually have to find something better.  Unfortunately, CVS
        had become the de facto standard in the open source world
        largely because there <emphasis>wasn't</emphasis> anything
        better, at least not under a free license.  So CollabNet
        determined to write a new version control system from scratch,
        retaining the basic ideas of CVS, but without the bugs and
        misfeatures.</para>
  
      <para>In February 2000, they contacted Karl Fogel, the author of
        <citetitle>Open Source Development with CVS</citetitle>
        (Coriolis, 1999), and asked if he'd like to work on this new
        project.  Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already
        discussing a design for a new version control system with his
        friend Jim Blandy.  In 1995, the two had started Cyclic
        Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and
        although they later sold the business, they still used CVS every
        day at their jobs.  Their frustration with CVS had led Jim to
        think carefully about better ways to manage versioned data, and
        he'd already come up with not only the name
        <quote>Subversion,</quote> but also the basic design of
        the Subversion data store.  When CollabNet called, Karl
        immediately agreed to work on the project, and Jim got his
        employer, Red Hat Software, to essentially donate him to the
        project for an indefinite period of time.  CollabNet hired
        Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and detailed design work began
        in May 2000.  With the help of some well-placed prods from
        Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of CollabNet, and from Greg
        Stein (at the time an independent developer active in the
        WebDAV/DeltaV specification process), Subversion quickly
        attracted a community of active developers.  It turned out
        that many people had encountered the same frustrating
        experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to finally do
        something about it.</para>
  
      <para>The original design team settled on some simple goals.  They
        didn't want to break new ground in version control methodology,
        they just wanted to fix CVS.  They decided that Subversion would
        match CVS's features and preserve the same development model,
        but not duplicate CVS's most obvious flaws.  And although it did
        not need to be a drop-in replacement for CVS, it should be
        similar enough that any CVS user could make the switch with

      <title>What's New in Subversion</title>

      <para>The first edition of this book was released in 2004,
        shortly after Subversion had reached 1.0.  Over the following
        four years Subversion released five major new versions, fixing
        bugs and adding major new features.  While we've managed to
        keep the online version of this book up to date, we're
        thrilled that the second edition from O'Reilly now covers
        Subversion up through release 1.5, a major milestone for the
        project.  Here's a quick summary of major new changes since
        Subversion 1.0.  Note that this is not a complete list; for
        full details, please visit Subversion's web site at
        <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org"/>.</para>

          <term>Subversion 1.1 (September 2004)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.1 introduced FSFS, a flat-file repository
              storage option for the repository.  While the Berkeley DB
              backend is still widely used and supported, FSFS has
              since become the default choice for
              newly created repositories due to its low barrier to
              entry and minimal maintenance requirements.  Also in
              this release came the ability to put symbolic links
              under version control, auto-escaping of URLs, and a
              localized user interface.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.2 introduced the ability to create
              server-side locks on files, thus serializing commit
              access to certain resources.  While Subversion is still
              a fundamentally concurrent version control system,
              certain types of binary files (e.g. art assets)
              cannot be merged together.  The locking feature fulfills
              the need to version and protect such resources.  With
              locking also came a complete WebDAV auto-versioning
              implementation, allowing Subversion repositories to be
              mounted as network folders.  Finally, Subversion 1.2
              began using a new, faster binary-differencing algorithm
              to compress and retrieve old versions of files.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.3 brought path-based authorization
              controls to the <command>svnserve</command> server,
              matching a feature formerly found only in the Apache
              server.  The Apache server, however, gained some new
              logging features of its own, and Subversion's API
              bindings to other languages also made great leaps
              forward.</para>

            <para>Release 1.4 introduced a whole new
              tool&#x2014;<command>svnsync</command>&#x2014;for doing
              one-way repository replication over a network.  Major
              parts of the working copy metadata were revamped to no
              longer use XML (resulting in client-side speed gains),
              while the Berkeley DB repository backend gained the
              ability to automatically recover itself after a server

          <listitem>
            <para>Release 1.5 took much longer to finish than prior
              releases, but the headliner feature was gigantic:
              semi-automated tracking of branching and merging.  This
              was a huge boon for users, and pushed Subversion far
              beyond the abilities of CVS and into the ranks of
              commercial competitors such as Perforce and ClearCase.
              Subversion 1.5 also introduced a bevy of other
              user-focused features, such as interactive resolution of
              file conflicts, partial checkouts, client-side
              management of changelists, powerful new syntax for
              externals definitions, and SASL authentication support for

  <chapter id="svn.basic">
  <title>Fundamental Concepts</title>

  <para>This chapter is a short, casual introduction to Subversion.
    If you're new to version control, this chapter is definitely for
    you.  We begin with a discussion of general version control
    concepts, work our way into the specific ideas behind
    Subversion, and show some simple examples of Subversion in
    use.</para>

  <para>Even though the examples in this chapter show people sharing
    collections of program source code, keep in mind that Subversion
    can manage any sort of file collection&#x2014;it's not limited to
    helping computer programmers.</para>

    <title>The Repository</title>

    <para>Subversion is a centralized system for sharing information.
      At its core is a repository, which is a central store of data.
      The repository stores information in the form of a
      <firstterm>filesystem tree</firstterm>&#x2014;a typical hierarchy
      of files and directories.  Any number of
      <firstterm>clients</firstterm> connect to the repository, and
      then read or write to these files.  By writing data, a client
      makes the information available to others; by reading data, the
      client receives information from others.  <xref linkend="svn.basic.repository.dia-1"/> illustrates this.</para>

    <figure id="svn.basic.repository.dia-1">
      <title>A typical client/server system</title>
      <graphic fileref="images/ch02dia1.png"/>
    </figure>

    <para>So why is this interesting?  So far, this sounds like the
      definition of a typical file server.  And indeed, the repository
      <emphasis>is</emphasis> a kind of file server, but it's not your
      usual breed.  What makes the Subversion repository special is
      that <emphasis>it remembers every change</emphasis> ever written
      to it&#x2014;every change to every file, and even changes to the
      directory tree itself, such as the addition, deletion, and
      rearrangement of files and directories.</para>

    <para>When a client reads data from the repository, it normally
      sees only the latest version of the filesystem tree.  But the
      client also has the ability to view
      <emphasis>previous</emphasis> states of the filesystem.  For
      example, a client can ask historical questions such
      as <quote>What did this directory contain last
      Wednesday?</quote> and <quote>Who was the last person to change
      this file, and what changes did he make?</quote> These are the
      sorts of questions that are at the heart of
      any <firstterm>version control system</firstterm>: systems that
      are designed to track changes to data over time.

  <sect1 id="svn.basic.vsn-models">
    <title>Versioning Models</title>

    <para>The core mission of a version control system is to enable
      collaborative editing and sharing of data.  But different
      systems use different strategies to achieve this.  It's
      important to understand these different strategies, for a couple
      of reasons.  First, it will help you compare and contrast
      existing version control systems, in case you encounter other
      systems similar to Subversion.  Beyond that, it will also help
      you make more effective use of Subversion, since Subversion
      itself supports a couple of different ways of working.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.basic.vsn-models.problem-sharing">
      <title>The Problem of File Sharing</title>

      <para>All version control systems have to solve the same
        fundamental problem: how will the system allow users to share
        information, but prevent them from accidentally stepping on
        each other's feet?  It's all too easy for users to
        accidentally overwrite each other's changes in the
        repository.</para>

      <para>Consider the scenario shown in <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models.problem-sharing.dia-1"/>.
        Suppose we have two coworkers, Harry and Sally.  They each
        decide to edit the same repository file at the same time.  If
        Harry saves his changes to the repository first, it's
        possible that (a few moments later) Sally could accidentally
        overwrite them with her own new version of the file.  While
        Harry's version of the file won't be lost forever (because the
        system remembers every change), any changes Harry made
        <emphasis>won't</emphasis> be present in Sally's newer version
        of the file, because she never saw Harry's changes to begin
        with.  Harry's work is still effectively lost&#x2014;or at
        least missing from the latest version of the file&#x2014;and
        probably by accident.  This is definitely a situation we want
        to avoid!</para>

      <title>The Lock-Modify-Unlock Solution</title>

      <para>Many version control systems use a
        <firstterm>lock-modify-unlock</firstterm> model to address the
        problem of many authors clobbering each other's work.  In this
        model, the repository allows only one person to change a file
        at a time.  This exclusivity policy is managed using locks.
        Harry must <quote>lock</quote> a file before he can begin
        making changes to it.  If Harry has locked a file, Sally
        cannot also lock it, and therefore cannot make any changes to
        that file.  All she can do is read the file and wait for
        Harry to finish his changes and release his lock.  After Harry
        unlocks the file, Sally can take her turn by locking and
        editing the file.  <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models.lock-unlock.dia-1"/>
        demonstrates this simple solution.</para>

      <para>The problem with the lock-modify-unlock model is that it's

        users:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Locking may cause administrative
            problems.</emphasis>

            Sometimes Harry will lock a file and then forget about it.
            Meanwhile, because Sally is still waiting to edit the file,
            her hands are tied.  And then Harry goes on vacation.  Now
            Sally has to get an administrator to release Harry's lock.
            The situation ends up causing a lot of unnecessary delay
            and wasted time.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Locking may cause unnecessary
            serialization.</emphasis>

            What if Harry is editing the beginning of a text file,
            and Sally simply wants to edit the end of the same file?
            These changes don't overlap at all.  They could easily
            edit the file simultaneously, and no great harm would
            come, assuming the changes were properly merged together.
            There's no need for them to take turns in this
            situation.</para>

            B depend on one another, and the changes made to each are
            semantically incompatible?  Suddenly A and B don't work
            together anymore.  The locking system was powerless to
            prevent the problem&#x2014;yet it somehow provided a false
            sense of security.  It's easy for Harry and Sally to
            imagine that by locking files, each is beginning a safe,
            insulated task, and thus they need not bother discussing
            their incompatible changes early on.  Locking often
            becomes a substitute for real communication.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge">
      <title>The Copy-Modify-Merge Solution</title>

      <para>Subversion, CVS, and many other version control systems
        use a <firstterm>copy-modify-merge</firstterm> model as an
        alternative to locking.  In this model, each user's client
        contacts the project repository and creates a personal
        <firstterm>working copy</firstterm>&#x2014;a local reflection
        of the repository's files and directories.  Users then work
        simultaneously and independently, modifying their private
        copies.  Finally, the private copies are merged together into
        a new, final version.  The version control system often
        assists with the merging, but ultimately, a human being is
        responsible for making it happen correctly.</para>

      <para>Here's an example.  Say that Harry and Sally each create
        working copies of the same project, copied from the
        repository.  They work concurrently and make changes to the
        same file A within their copies.  Sally saves her changes to
        the repository first.  When Harry attempts to save his changes
        later, the repository informs him that his file A is
        <firstterm>out of date</firstterm>.  In other words, file
        A in the repository has somehow changed since he last copied
        it.  So Harry asks his client to <firstterm>merge</firstterm>
        any new changes from the repository into his working copy of
        file A.  Chances are that Sally's changes don't overlap with
        his own; once he has both sets of changes integrated, he
        saves his working copy back to the repository.  <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge.dia-1"/> and <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge.dia-2"/> show this
        process.</para>

        <graphic fileref="images/ch02dia5.png"/>
      </figure>

      <para>But what if Sally's changes <emphasis>do</emphasis> overlap
        with Harry's changes?  What then?  This situation is called a
        <firstterm>conflict</firstterm>, and it's usually not much of
        a problem.  When Harry asks his client to merge the latest
        repository changes into his working copy, his copy of file A
        is somehow flagged as being in a state of conflict: he'll be
        able to see both sets of conflicting changes and manually
        choose between them.  Note that software can't automatically
        resolve conflicts; only humans are capable of understanding
        and making the necessary intelligent choices.  Once Harry has
        manually resolved the overlapping changes&#x2014;perhaps after
        a discussion with Sally&#x2014;he can safely save the
        merged file back to the repository.</para>

      <para>The copy-modify-merge model may sound a bit chaotic, but
        in practice, it runs extremely smoothly.  Users can work in
        parallel, never waiting for one another.  When they work on
        the same files, it turns out that most of their concurrent
        changes don't overlap at all; conflicts are infrequent.  And
        the amount of time it takes to resolve conflicts is usually
        far less than the time lost by a locking system.</para>

      <para>In the end, it all comes down to one critical factor: user
        communication.  When users communicate poorly, both syntactic
        and semantic conflicts increase.  No system can force users to
        communicate perfectly, and no system can detect semantic
        conflicts.  So there's no point in being lulled into a false
        sense of security that a locking system will somehow prevent
        conflicts; in practice, locking seems to inhibit productivity
        more than anything else.</para>

      <sidebar id="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge.sb-1">
        <title>When Locking Is Necessary</title>

        <para>While the lock-modify-unlock model is considered
          generally harmful to collaboration, sometimes
          locking is appropriate.</para>

        <para>The copy-modify-merge model is based on the assumption
          that files are contextually mergeable&#x2014;that is, that the
          majority of the files in the repository are line-based text
          files (such as program source code).  But for files with
          binary formats, such as artwork or sound, it's often
          impossible to merge conflicting changes.  In these
          situations, it really is necessary for users to take strict
          turns when changing the file.  Without serialized access,
          somebody ends up wasting time on changes that are ultimately
          discarded.</para>

        <para>While Subversion is primarily a copy-modify-merge
          system, it still recognizes the need to lock an occasional
          file, and thus provides mechanisms for this.  We discuss
          this feature in <xref linkend="svn.advanced.locking"/>.</para>

    <title>Subversion in Action</title>

    <para>It's time to move from the abstract to the concrete.  In
      this section, we'll show real examples of Subversion being
      used.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.reposurls">
      <title>Subversion Repository URLs</title>

      <para>Throughout this book, Subversion uses URLs to identify
        versioned files and directories in Subversion repositories.
        For the most part, these URLs use the standard syntax,
        allowing for server names and port numbers to be specified as
        part of the URL:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com:9834/repos
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>But there are some nuances in Subversion's handling of URLs
        that are notable.  For example, URLs containing the
        <literal>file://</literal> access method (used for local
        repositories) must, in accordance with convention, have either a
        server name of <literal>localhost</literal> or no server name at
        all:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos
&#x2026;
$ svn checkout file://localhost/var/svn/repos
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>Also, users of the <literal>file://</literal> scheme on
        Windows platforms will need to use an unofficially
        <quote>standard</quote> syntax for accessing repositories
        that are on the same machine, but on a different drive than
        the client's current working drive.  Either of the two
        following URL path syntaxes will work, where
        <literal>X</literal> is the drive on which the repository
        resides:</para>

      <screen>
C:\&gt; svn checkout file:///X:/var/svn/repos
&#x2026;
C:\&gt; svn checkout "file:///X|/var/svn/repos"
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>In the second syntax, you need to quote the URL so that the
        vertical bar character is not interpreted as a pipe.  Also, note
        that a URL uses forward slashes even though the native
        (non-URL) form of a path on Windows uses backslashes.</para>

      <note>
        <para>You cannot use Subversion's <literal>file://</literal> URLs
          in a regular web browser the way typical
          <literal>file://</literal> URLs can.  When you attempt to view
          a <literal>file://</literal> URL in a regular web browser, it
          reads and displays the contents of the file at that location
          by examining the filesystem directly.  However, Subversion's
          resources exist in a virtual filesystem (see <xref linkend="svn.developer.layerlib.repos"/>), and your browser
          will not understand how to interact with that
          filesystem.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The Subversion client will automatically encode URLs as
        necessary, just like a web browser does.  For example, if a
        URL contains a space or upper-ASCII character as in the
        following:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout "http://host/path with space/project/espa&#xF1;a"
</screen>

      <para>then Subversion will escape the unsafe characters
        and behave as though you had typed:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout http://host/path%20with%20space/project/espa%C3%B1a
</screen>

      <para>If the URL contains spaces, be sure to place it within quotation
        marks so that your shell treats the whole thing as a single
        argument to the <command>svn</command> program.</para>

      <para>In Subversion 1.6, a new caret (<literal>^</literal>)
        notation was introduced as a shorthand for <quote>the URL of
        the repository's root directory</quote>.  For example:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn list ^/tags/bigsandwich/
</screen>

        <para>In this example, we're specifying a URL for
        the <filename>/tags/bigsandwich</filename> directory in the
        root of the repository.  Note that this URL
        syntax <emphasis>only</emphasis> works when your current
        working directory is a working copy&#x2014;the commandline
        client knows the repository's root URL by looking at the
        working copy's metadata.</para>


      <sidebar id="svn.basic.in-action.wc.sb-1">

        <para>You can access Subversion repositories through many

      <title>Working Copies</title>

      <para>You've already read about working copies; now we'll
        demonstrate how the Subversion client creates and uses
        them.</para>

      <para>A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on
        your local system, containing a collection of files.  You can
        edit these files however you wish, and if they're source code
        files, you can compile your program from them in the usual
        way.  Your working copy is your own private work area:
        Subversion will never incorporate other people's changes, nor
        make your own changes available to others, until you
        explicitly tell it to do so.  You can even have multiple
        working copies of the same project.</para>

      <para>After you've made some changes to the files in your
        working copy and verified that they work properly, Subversion
        provides you with commands to <quote>publish</quote> your
        changes to the other people working with you on your project
        (by writing to the repository).  If other people publish their
        own changes, Subversion provides you with commands to merge
        those changes into your working copy (by reading from the
        repository).</para>

      <para>A working copy also contains some extra files, created and
        maintained by Subversion, to help it carry out these commands.
        In particular, each directory in your working copy contains a
        subdirectory named <filename>.svn</filename>, also known as
        the working copy's <firstterm>administrative
        directory</firstterm>.  The files in each administrative
        directory help Subversion recognize which files contain
        unpublished changes, and which files are out of date with
        respect to others' work.</para>

      <para>A typical Subversion repository often holds the files (or
        source code) for several projects; usually, each project is a
        subdirectory in the repository's filesystem tree.  In this
        arrangement, a user's working copy will usually correspond to
        a particular subtree of the repository.</para>

      <para>For example, suppose you have a repository that contains
        two software projects, <literal>paint</literal> and
        <literal>calc</literal>.  Each project lives in its own
        top-level subdirectory, as shown in <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1"/>.</para>

      <figure id="svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1">
        <title>The repository's filesystem</title>
        <graphic fileref="images/ch02dia6.png"/>
      </figure>

      <para>To get a working copy, you must <firstterm>check
        out</firstterm> some subtree of the repository.  (The term
        <emphasis>check out</emphasis> may sound like it has something to do
        with locking or reserving resources, but it doesn't; it simply
        creates a private copy of the project for you.) For example,
        if you check out <filename>/calc</filename>, you will get a
        working copy like this:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
A    calc/Makefile
A    calc/integer.c
A    calc/button.c
Checked out revision 56.

$ ls -A calc
Makefile  button.c integer.c .svn/
</screen>

      <para>The list of letter <literal>A</literal>s in the left
        margin indicates that Subversion is adding a number of items
        to your working copy.  You now have a personal copy of the
        repository's <filename>/calc</filename> directory, with one
        additional entry&#x2014;<filename>.svn</filename>&#x2014;which
        holds the extra information needed by Subversion, as mentioned
        earlier.</para>

      <para>Suppose you make changes to <filename>button.c</filename>.
        Since the <filename>.svn</filename> directory remembers the
        file's original modification date and contents, Subversion can
        tell that you've changed the file.  However, Subversion does
        not make your changes public until you explicitly tell it to.
        The act of publishing your changes is more commonly known as
        <firstterm>committing</firstterm> (or <firstterm>checking
        in</firstterm>) changes to the repository.</para>

      <para>To publish your changes to others, you can use
        Subversion's <command>svn commit</command> command:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn commit button.c -m "Fixed a typo in button.c."
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 57.
</screen>

      <para>Now your changes to <filename>button.c</filename> have
        been committed to the repository, with a note describing your
        change (namely, that you fixed a typo).  If another user
        checks out a working copy of <filename>/calc</filename>, she
        will see your changes in the latest version of the
        file.</para>

      <para>Suppose you have a collaborator, Sally, who checked out a
        working copy of <filename>/calc</filename> at the same time
        you did.  When you commit your change to
        <filename>button.c</filename>, Sally's working copy is left
        unchanged; Subversion modifies working copies only at the
        user's request.</para>

      <para>To bring her project up to date, Sally can ask Subversion
        to <firstterm>update</firstterm> her working copy, by using
        the <command>svn update</command> command.  This will incorporate
        your changes into her working copy, as well as any others that
        have been committed since she checked it out.</para>

      <screen>
$ pwd
/home/sally/calc

$ ls -A
Makefile button.c integer.c .svn/

$ svn update
U    button.c
Updated to revision 57.
</screen>

      <para>The output from the <command>svn update</command> command
        indicates that Subversion updated the contents of
        <filename>button.c</filename>.  Note that Sally didn't need to
        specify which files to update; Subversion uses the information
        in the <filename>.svn</filename> directory as well as further
        information in the repository, to decide which files need to
        be brought up to date.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.basic.in-action.revs">
      <title>Revisions</title>

      <para>An <command>svn commit</command> operation publishes
        changes to any number of files and directories as a single
        atomic transaction.  In your working copy, you can change
        files' contents; create, delete, rename, and copy files and
        directories; and then commit a complete set of changes as an
        atomic transaction.</para>

      <para>By atomic transaction, we mean simply this: either all of
        the changes happen in the repository, or none of them happens.
        Subversion tries to retain this atomicity in the face of
        program crashes, system crashes, network problems, and other
        users' actions.</para>

      <para>Each time the repository accepts a commit, this creates a
        new state of the filesystem tree, called a
        <firstterm>revision</firstterm>.  Each revision is assigned a
        unique natural number, one greater than the number of the
        previous revision.  The initial revision of a freshly created
        repository is numbered 0 and consists of nothing but an
        empty root directory.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1"/> illustrates a nice way to
        visualize the repository.  Imagine an array of revision
        numbers, starting at 0, stretching from left to right.  Each
        revision number has a filesystem tree hanging below it, and
        each tree is a <quote>snapshot</quote> of the way the
        repository looked after a commit.</para>

      <figure id="svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1">

      <sidebar>
        <title>Global Revision Numbers</title>

        <para>Unlike most version control systems, Subversion's
          revision numbers apply to <emphasis>entire trees</emphasis>,
          not individual files.  Each revision number selects an
          entire tree, a particular state of the repository after some
          committed change.  Another way to think about it is that
          revision N represents the state of the repository filesystem
          after the Nth commit.  When Subversion users talk
          about <quote>revision 5 of
          <filename>foo.c</filename>,</quote> they really mean
          <quote><filename>foo.c</filename> as it appears in revision
          5.</quote> Notice that in general, revisions N and M of a
          file do <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessarily differ!  Many
          other version control systems use per-file revision numbers,
          so this concept may seem unusual at first. (Former CVS users
          might want to see <xref linkend="svn.forcvs"/> for more
          details.)</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>It's important to note that working copies do not always
        correspond to any single revision in the repository; they may
        contain files from several different revisions.  For example,
        suppose you check out a working copy from a repository whose
        most recent revision is 4:</para>

      <screen>
calc/Makefile:4
     integer.c:4
     button.c:4
</screen>

      <para>At the moment, this working directory corresponds exactly
        to revision 4 in the repository.  However, suppose you make a
        change to <filename>button.c</filename>, and commit that
        change.  Assuming no other commits have taken place, your
        commit will create revision 5 of the repository, and your
        working copy will now look like this:</para>

      <screen>
calc/Makefile:4
     integer.c:4
     button.c:5
</screen>

      <para>Suppose that, at this point, Sally commits a change to
        <filename>integer.c</filename>, creating revision 6.  If you
        use <command>svn update</command> to bring your working copy
        up to date, it will look like this:</para>

      <screen>
calc/Makefile:6
     integer.c:6
     button.c:6
</screen>

      <para>Sally's change to <filename>integer.c</filename> will
        appear in your working copy, and your change will still be
        present in <filename>button.c</filename>.  In this example,
        the text of <filename>Makefile</filename> is identical in
        revisions 4, 5, and 6, but Subversion will mark your working
        copy of <filename>Makefile</filename> with revision 6 to
        indicate that it is still current.  So, after you do a clean
        update at the top of your working copy, it will generally
        correspond to exactly one revision in the repository.</para>

      <title>Mixed Revision Working Copies</title>

      <para>As a general principle, Subversion tries to be as flexible
        as possible.  One special kind of flexibility is the ability
        to have a working copy containing files and directories with a
        mix of different working revision numbers.  Unfortunately,
        this flexibility tends to confuse a number of new users.  If
        the earlier example showing mixed revisions perplexed you,
        here's a primer on why the feature exists and how to make
        use of it.</para>

      <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
      <sect3 id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit">
        <title>Updates and commits are separate</title>

        <para>One of the fundamental rules of Subversion is that
          a <quote>push</quote> action does not cause
          a <quote>pull,</quote> nor vice versa.  Just
          because you're ready to submit new changes to the repository
          doesn't mean you're ready to receive changes from other
          people.  And if you have new changes still in progress,
          <command>svn update</command> should gracefully merge
          repository changes into your own, rather than forcing you to
          publish them.</para>

        <para>The main side effect of this rule is that it means a
          working copy has to do extra bookkeeping to track mixed
          revisions as well as be tolerant of the mixture.  It's made
          more complicated by the fact that directories themselves are
          versioned.</para>

        <para>For example, suppose you have a working copy entirely at
          revision 10.  You edit the
          file <filename>foo.html</filename> and then perform
          an <command>svn commit</command>, which creates revision 15
          in the repository.  After the commit succeeds, many new
          users would expect the working copy to be entirely at
          revision 15, but that's not the case!  Any number of changes
          might have happened in the repository between revisions 10
          and 15.  The client knows nothing of those changes in the
          repository, since you haven't yet run <command>svn
          update</command>, and <command>svn commit</command> doesn't
          pull down new changes.  If, on the other hand,
          <command>svn commit</command> were to automatically download
          the newest changes, it would be possible to set the
          entire working copy to revision 15&#x2014;but then we'd be
          breaking the fundamental rule of <quote>push</quote>
          and <quote>pull</quote> remaining separate actions.
          Therefore, the only safe thing the Subversion client can do
          is mark the one
          file&#x2014;<filename>foo.html</filename>&#x2014;as being at
          revision 15.  The rest of the working copy remains at
          revision 10.  Only by running <command>svn update</command>
          can the latest changes be downloaded and the whole working
          copy be marked as revision 15.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.normal">
        <title>Mixed revisions are normal</title>

        <para>The fact is, <emphasis>every time</emphasis> you run
          <command>svn commit</command> your working copy ends up
          with some mixture of revisions.  The things you just
          committed are marked as having larger working revisions than
          everything else.  After several commits (with no updates
          in between), your working copy will contain a whole mixture
          of revisions.  Even if you're the only person using the
          repository, you will still see this phenomenon.  To examine
          your mixture of working revisions, use the <command>svn
          status</command> command with the <option>--verbose</option> option (see <xref linkend="svn.tour.cycle.examine.status"/> for more
          information).</para>

        <para>Often, new users are completely unaware that their
          working copy contains mixed revisions.  This can be
          confusing, because many client commands are sensitive to the
          working revision of the item they're examining.  For
          example, the <command>svn log</command> command is used to
          display the history of changes to a file or directory (see
          <xref linkend="svn.tour.history.log"/>).  When the user
          invokes this command on a working copy object, he expects
          to see the entire history of the object.  But if the
          object's working revision is quite old (often because
          <command>svn update</command> hasn't been run in a long
          time), the history of the <emphasis>older</emphasis>
          version of the object is shown.</para>

        <para>However you make use of mixed revisions in your working

        <para>First, you cannot commit the deletion of a file or

          attaching <quote>properties</quote> to items in <xref linkend="svn.advanced"/>.  A directory's working revision
          defines a specific set of entries and properties, and thus

      ever need when using Subversion: <command>svn help</command>.
      The Subversion command-line client is self-documenting&#x2014;at
      any time, a quick <userinput>svn help
      <replaceable>subcommand</replaceable></userinput> will describe
      the syntax, options, and behavior of the subcommand.</para>

$ svn help import
import: Commit an unversioned file or tree into the repository.
usage: import [PATH] URL

  Recursively commit a copy of PATH to URL.
  If PATH is omitted '.' is assumed.
  Parent directories are created as necessary in the repository.
  If PATH is a directory, the contents of the directory are added
  directly under URL.
  Unversionable items such as device files and pipes are ignored
  if --force is specified.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',

        <title>Options and Switches and Flags, Oh My!</title>
        
        <para>The Subversion command-line client has numerous command
          modifiers (which we call options), but there are two
          distinct kinds of options:  short options
          are a single hyphen followed by a single letter, and
          long options consist of two hyphens
          followed by a number of letters (e.g., <literal>-s</literal>
          and <literal>--this-is-a-long-option</literal>,
          respectively).  Every option has a long format, but only
          certain options have an additional short format (these are
          typically options that are frequently used).  To
          maintain clarity, we <emphasis>usually</emphasis> use the
          long form in code examples, but when describing options, if
          there's a short form, we'll provide the long form (to
          improve clarity) and the short form (to make it easier to
          remember).  You should use whichever one you're more
          comfortable with, but don't try to use both.</para>

      <para>The <command>svn import</command> command is a quick way to
        copy an unversioned tree of files into a repository, creating
        intermediate directories as necessary.  <command>svn
        import</command> doesn't require a working copy, and your files
        are immediately committed to the repository.  You typically
        use this when you have an existing tree of files that you want to
        begin tracking in your Subversion repository.  For example:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/newrepos
$ svn import mytree file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project \
             -m "Initial import"

$ svn list file:///var/svn/newrepos/some/project

      <para>Note that after the import is finished, the original tree

      project.  Checking out a repository creates a <quote>working

    <sidebar>
      <title>What's in a Name?</title>

      <para>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you
        can place under version control.  The contents of files and
        property values are stored and transmitted as binary data, and
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/>
        tells you how to give Subversion a hint that
        <quote>textual</quote> operations don't make sense for a
        particular file.  There are a few places, however, where
        Subversion places restrictions on information it
        stores.</para>

      <para>Subversion internally handles certain bits of
        data&#x2014;for example, property names, pathnames, and log
        messages&#x2014;as UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  This is not to say
        that all your interactions with Subversion must involve UTF-8,
        though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will gracefully
        and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
        encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion
        can meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common
        encodings in use today).</para>

      <para>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of
        Subversion's administrative files, paths are used as XML
        attribute values, and property names in XML tag names.  This
        means that pathnames can contain only legal XML (1.0)
        characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
        characters.  Subversion also prohibits <literal>TAB</literal>,
        <literal>CR</literal>, and <literal>LF</literal> characters in
        path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or
        in the output of commands such as <command>svn log</command>
        or <command>svn status</command>.</para>

      <para>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice
        these limitations are rarely a problem.  As long as your
        locale settings are compatible with UTF-8 and you don't use
        control characters in path names, you should have no trouble
        communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds
        an extra bit of help&#x2014;to create
        <quote>legally correct</quote> versions for internal
        use it will automatically escape illegal
        path characters as needed in URLs that you type.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Although the preceding example checks out the trunk directory,
      you can just as easily check out any deep subdirectory of a
      repository by specifying the subdirectory in the checkout
      URL:</para>

</screen>

    <para>Since Subversion uses a copy-modify-merge
      model instead of lock-modify-unlock (see
      <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models"/>), you can immediately
      make changes to the files and directories in your working
      copy.  Your working copy is just like any other collection of
      files and directories on your system.  You can edit and change
      it, move it around, even delete the entire working copy and
      forget about it.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>While your working copy is <quote>just like any other
          collection of files and directories on your system,</quote>
          you can edit files at will, but you must tell Subversion
          about <emphasis>everything else</emphasis> that you do.  For
          example, if you want to copy or move an item in a working
          copy, you should use <command>svn copy</command> or
          <command>svn move</command> instead of the copy and move
          commands provided by your operating system.  We'll talk more
          about them later in this chapter.</para>

    <para>Unless you're ready to commit the addition of a new file or

      <para>Every directory in a working copy contains an
        administrative area&#x2014;a subdirectory named
        <filename>.svn</filename>.  Usually, directory listing
        commands won't show this subdirectory, but it is nevertheless
        an important directory.  Whatever you do, don't delete or
        change anything in the administrative area!  Subversion
        depends on it to manage your working copy.</para>

      <para>If you accidentally remove the <filename>.svn</filename>
        subdirectory, the easiest way to fix the problem is to remove
        the entire containing directory (a normal system deletion,
        not <command>svn delete</command>), then run <userinput>svn
        update</userinput> from a parent directory.  The Subversion
        client will download the directory you've deleted, with a
        new <filename>.svn</filename> area as well.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>While you can certainly check out a working copy with the
      URL of the repository as the only argument, you can also specify
      a directory after your repository URL.  This places your working
      copy in the new directory that you name.  For example:</para>

    <screen>
$  svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subv
A    subv/Makefile.in
A    subv/ac-helpers
A    subv/ac-helpers/install.sh
A    subv/ac-helpers/install-sh
A    subv/build.conf
&#x2026;
Checked out revision 8810.
</screen>

    <para>That will place your working copy in a directory named
      <literal>subv</literal> instead of a directory named
      <literal>trunk</literal> as we did previously.  The directory
      <literal>subv</literal> will be created if it doesn't already
      exist.</para>


    <sect2 id="svn.tour.initial.disabling-password-caching">
      <title>Disabling Password Caching</title>

      <para>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires you
        to authenticate, by default Subversion tries to cache your
        authentication credentials on disk in encrypted form.
        On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt your
        authentication data. You will then be asked whether you
        want to cache your credentials to disk in plaintext.
        You can choose to do so for convenience so that you don't have
        to continually reenter your password for future operations.
        If you're concerned about caching your Subversion passwords
        in plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and
        again, you can disable caching of plaintext passwords either
        permanently, or on a server-per-server basis.</para>

      <para>To permanently disable caching of passwords in plaintext,
        you can add the line
        <literal>store-plaintext-passwords = no</literal>
        to the global section in the <filename>servers</filename>
        configuration file on the local machine.  To disable caching
        of plaintext passwords for a particular server, use the same
        setting in the appropriate group section in the
        <filename>servers</filename> configuration file.
        See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts"/>
        in <xref linkend="svn.customization"/> for details.</para>

      <para>You can also disable caching of authentication credentials
        entirely, regardless of whether the credentials are stored
        in encrypted form or not.</para>

      <para>To disable password caching entirely for a particular one-time
        command, pass the <option>--no-auth-cache</option> option on
        the command line.  To permanently disable caching entirely,
        you can add the line <literal>store-passwords = no</literal>
        to your local machine's Subversion configuration file.  See <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/> for
        details.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.tour.initial.different-user">
      <title>Authenticating As a Different User</title>

      <para>Since Subversion caches auth credentials by default (both
        username and password), it conveniently remembers who you were
        acting as the last time you modified your working copy.  But
        sometimes that's not helpful&#x2014;particularly if you're
        working in a shared working copy such as a system
        configuration directory or a web server document root.  In this
        case, just pass the <option>--username</option> option on the
        command line, and Subversion will attempt to authenticate as
        that user, prompting you for a password if necessary.</para>

      <title>Update Your Working Copy</title>

      <para>When working on a project with a team, you'll want to
        update your working copy to receive any changes other developers 
        on the project have made since your last update.  Use
        <command>svn update</command> to bring your working copy into
        sync with the latest revision in the repository:</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cycle.edit">
      <title>Make Changes to Your Working Copy</title>

      <para>Now you can get to work and make changes in your working
        copy.  It's usually most convenient to decide on a discrete
        change (or set of changes) to make, such as writing a new
        feature, fixing a bug, and so on.  The Subversion commands that you
        will use here are <command>svn add</command>, <command>svn
        delete</command>, <command>svn copy</command>, <command>svn
        move</command>, and <command>svn mkdir</command>.  However, if
        you are merely editing files that are already in Subversion,
        you may not need to use any of these commands until you
        commit.</para>

      <para>You can make two kinds of changes to your
        working copy: <firstterm>file changes</firstterm>
        and <firstterm>tree changes</firstterm>.  You don't need to
        tell Subversion that you intend to change a file; just make
        your changes using your text editor, word processor, graphics
        program, or whatever tool you would normally use.  Subversion
        automatically detects which files have been changed, and in
        addition, it handles binary files just as easily as it handles
        text files&#x2014;and just as efficiently, too.  For tree
        changes, you can ask Subversion to <quote>mark</quote> files
        and directories for scheduled removal, addition, copying, or
        moving.  These changes may take place immediately in your
        working copy, but no additions or removals will happen in the
        repository until you commit them.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Versioning Symbolic Links</title>

        <para>On non-Windows platforms, Subversion is able to version
          files of the special type <firstterm>symbolic
          link</firstterm> (or <quote>symlink</quote>).  A symlink is
          a file that acts as a sort of transparent reference to some
          other object in the filesystem, allowing programs to read
          and write to those objects indirectly by way of performing
          operations on the symlink itself.</para>

        <para>When a symlink is committed into a Subversion
          repository, Subversion remembers that the file was in fact a
          symlink, as well as the object to which the symlink
          <quote>points.</quote>  When that symlink is checked out to
          another working copy on a non-Windows system, Subversion
          reconstructs a real filesystem-level symbolic link from the
          versioned symlink.  But that doesn't in any way limit the
          usability of working copies on systems such as Windows that
          do not support symlinks.  On such systems, Subversion simply
          creates a regular text file whose contents are the path to
          which to the original symlink pointed.  While that file
          can't be used as a symlink on a Windows system, it also
          won't prevent Windows users from performing their other
          Subversion-related activities.</para> </sidebar>

      <para>Here is an overview of the five Subversion subcommands
        that you'll use most often to make tree changes:</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><userinput>svn add foo</userinput></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <filename>foo</filename> to be added to the repository.
              When you next commit, <filename>foo</filename> will
              become a child of its parent directory.  Note that if
              <filename>foo</filename> is a directory, everything
              underneath <filename>foo</filename> will be scheduled
              for addition.  If you want only to add
              <filename>foo</filename> itself, pass the
              <option>--depth empty</option> option.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><userinput>svn delete foo</userinput></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Schedule file, directory, or symbolic link
              <filename>foo</filename> to be deleted from the
              repository.  If <filename>foo</filename> is a file or
              link, it is immediately deleted from your working copy.
              If <filename>foo</filename> is a directory, it is not
              deleted, but Subversion schedules it for deletion.  When
              you commit your changes, <filename>foo</filename> will
              be entirely removed from your working copy and the
              repository.
              <footnote>
                <para>Of course, nothing is ever totally deleted from
                  the repository&#x2014;just from the
                  <literal>HEAD</literal> of the repository.  You can
                  get back anything you delete by checking out (or
                  updating your working copy to) a revision earlier
                  than the one in which you deleted it. Also see <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.resurrect"/>.</para>
              </footnote>
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><userinput>svn copy foo bar</userinput></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Create a new item <filename>bar</filename> as a
              duplicate of <filename>foo</filename> and automatically
              schedule <filename>bar</filename> for addition.  When
              <filename>bar</filename> is added to the repository on
              the next commit, its copy history is recorded (as having
              originally come from <filename>foo</filename>).
              <command>svn copy</command> does not create intermediate
              directories unless you pass the
              <option>--parents</option> option.</para>

              addition as a copy of <filename>foo</filename>, and
              <filename>foo</filename> is scheduled for removal.
              <command>svn move</command> does not create intermediate

      <sidebar>
        <title>Changing the Repository Without a Working Copy</title>

        <para>There <emphasis>are</emphasis> some use cases that
          immediately commit tree changes to the repository.  This
          happens only when a subcommand is operating directly on a
          URL, rather than on a working-copy path.  In particular,
          specific uses of <command>svn mkdir</command>, <command>svn
          copy</command>, <command>svn move</command>, and
          <command>svn delete</command> can work with URLs (and don't
          forget that <command>svn import</command> always makes
          changes to a URL).</para>

        <para>URL operations behave in this manner because commands
          that operate on a working copy can use the working copy as a
          sort of <quote>staging area</quote> to set up your changes
          before committing them to the repository.  Commands that
          operate on URLs don't have this luxury, so when you operate
          directly on a URL, any of the aforementioned actions represents an
          immediate commit.</para>

      </sidebar>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cycle.examine">
      <title>Examine Your Changes</title>

      <para>Once you've finished making changes, you need to commit
        them to the repository, but before you do so, it's usually a
        good idea to take a look at exactly what you've changed.  By
        examining your changes before you commit, you can make a more
        accurate log message.  You may also discover that you've
        inadvertently changed a file, and this gives you a chance to
        revert those changes before committing.  Additionally, this is
        a good opportunity to review and scrutinize changes before
        publishing them.  You can see an overview of the changes
        you've made by using <command>svn status</command>, and dig
        into the details of those changes by using <command>svn
        diff</command>.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Look Ma! No Network!</title>

        <para>You can use the commands <command>svn status</command>,
          <command>svn diff</command>, and <command>svn
          revert</command> without any network access even
          if your repository <emphasis>is</emphasis> across the
          network.  This makes it easy to manage your
          changes-in-progress when you are somewhere without a network
          connection, such as traveling on an airplane, riding a
          commuter train, or hacking on the beach.
          <footnote>
            <para>And you don't have a WLAN card.  Thought
              you got us, huh?</para>
          </footnote>
        </para>

        <para>Subversion does this by keeping private caches of
          pristine versions of each versioned file inside the
          <filename>.svn</filename> administrative areas.  This allows
          Subversion to report&#x2014;and revert&#x2014;local
          modifications to those files <emphasis>without network
          access</emphasis>.  This cache (called the
          <quote>text-base</quote>) also allows Subversion to send the
          user's local modifications during a commit to the server as
          a compressed <firstterm>delta</firstterm> (or
          <quote>difference</quote>) against the pristine version.
          Having this cache is a tremendous benefit&#x2014;even if you
          have a fast Internet connection, it's much faster to send only a
          file's changes rather than the whole file to the
          server.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Subversion has been optimized to help you with this task,
        and it is able to do many things without communicating with
        the repository.  In particular, your working copy contains a
        hidden cached <quote>pristine</quote> copy of each version-controlled
        file within the <filename>.svn</filename> area.
        Because of this, Subversion can quickly show you how your
        working files have changed or even allow you to undo your
        changes without contacting the repository.</para>

        <title>Resolving conflict differences interactively</title>

        <para>There are four different ways to resolve conflicts
          interactively&#x2014;two of which allow you to selectively
          merge and edit changes, and two of which allow you to simply
          pick a version of the file and move along.</para>

        <para>If you wish to choose some combination of your local
          changes, you can use the <quote>edit</quote> command
          (<userinput>e</userinput>) to manually edit the file with
          conflict markers in a text editor (determined by the
          <literal>EDITOR</literal> environment variable).  Editing
          the file by hand in your favorite text editor is a somewhat
          low-tech way of remedying conflicts (see <xref linkend="svn.tour.cycle.resolve.byhand"/> for a
          walkthrough), so some people like to use fancy graphical
          merge tools instead.</para>

        <para>To use a merge tool, you need to either set the
          <literal>SVN_MERGE</literal> environment variable or define
          the <literal>merge-tool-cmd</literal> option in your
          Subversion configuration file (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts"/> for more details).
          Subversion will pass four arguments to the merge tool: the
          <literal>BASE</literal> revision of the file, the revision
          of the file received from the server as part of the update,
          the copy of the file containing your local edits, and
          the merged copy of the file (which contains conflict
          markers).  If your merge tool is expecting arguments in a
          different order or format, you'll need to write a wrapper
          script for Subversion to invoke.  After you've edited the
          file, if you're satisfied with the changes you've made, you
          can tell Subversion that the edited file is no longer in
          conflict by using the <quote>resolve</quote> command
          (<literal>r</literal>).</para>

        <para>If you decide that you don't need to merge any changes,
          but just want to accept one version of the file or the

          <quote>mine</quote>) by using the <quote>mine-full</quote>

        <title>Postponing conflict resolution</title>

        <para>This may sound like an appropriate section for avoiding
          marital disagreements, but it's actually still about
          Subversion, so read on.  If you're doing an update and
          encounter a conflict that you're not prepared to review or
          resolve, you can type <userinput>p</userinput> to postpone
          resolving a conflict on a file-by-file basis when you run
          <userinput>svn update</userinput>.  If you're running an update
          and don't want to resolve any conflicts, you can pass the
          <option>--non-interactive</option> option to <command>svn
          update</command>, and any file in conflict will be marked
          with a <computeroutput>C</computeroutput>
          automatically.</para>

        <para>The <computeroutput>C</computeroutput> stands for
          <computeroutput>c</computeroutput>onflict.  This means that
          the changes from the server overlapped with your own, and
          now you have to manually choose between them after the
          update has completed.  When you postpone a conflict
          resolution, <command>svn</command> typically does three
          things to assist you in noticing and resolving that
          conflict:</para>

        <itemizedlist>

          <listitem>
            <para>Subversion prints a <computeroutput>C</computeroutput>

              delimit the <quote>sides</quote> of the
              conflict&#x2014;into the file to visibly demonstrate the
              overlapping areas.  (Subversion uses the
              <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to decide whether a
              file is capable of contextual, line-based merging.  See

        <para>For example, Sally makes changes to the file

        <para>If you've postponed a conflict, you need to resolve the

          the <option>--accept</option> option.</para>

        <para>If you want to choose the version of the file that you

        <para>However, if you want to pick and choose from your

        <title>Merging conflicts by hand</title>

        <para>Merging conflicts by hand can be quite intimidating the
          first time you attempt it, but with a little practice, it
          can become as easy as falling off a bike.</para>

        <para>Here's an example.  Due to a miscommunication, you and
          Sally, your collaborator, both edit the file
          <filename>sandwich.txt</filename> at the same time.  Sally
          commits her changes, and when you go to update your working
          copy, you get a conflict and you're going to have to edit
          <filename>sandwich.txt</filename> to resolve the conflict.
          First, let's take a look at the file:</para>

        <screen>
$ cat sandwich.txt
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread
</screen>

        <para>The strings of less-than signs, equals signs, and
          greater-than signs are conflict markers and are not part of
          the actual data in conflict.  You generally want to ensure
          that those are removed from the file before your next
          commit.  The text between the first two sets of markers is
          composed of the changes you made in the conflicting
          area:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
=======
</screen>

        <para>The text between the second and third sets of conflict
          markers is the text from Sally's commit:</para>

        <screen>
=======
Sauerkraut
Grilled Chicken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r2
</screen>

        <para>Usually you won't want to just delete the conflict
          markers and Sally's changes&#x2014;she's going to be awfully
          surprised when the sandwich arrives and it's not what she
          wanted.  This is where you pick up the phone or walk
          across the office and explain to Sally that you can't get
          sauerkraut from an Italian deli.
          <footnote>
            <para>And if you ask them for it, they may very well ride
              you out of town on a rail.</para>
          </footnote>
          Once you've agreed on the changes you will commit, edit
          your file and remove the conflict markers:</para>

        <screen>
Top piece of bread
Mayonnaise
Lettuce
Tomato
Provolone
Salami
Mortadella
Prosciutto
Creole Mustard
Bottom piece of bread
</screen>

        <para>Now use <command>svn resolve</command>, and you're
          ready to commit your changes:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn resolve --accept working sandwich.txt
Resolved conflicted state of 'sandwich.txt'
$ svn commit -m "Go ahead and use my sandwich, discarding Sally's edits."
</screen>

        <para>Note that <command>svn resolve</command>, unlike most of
          the other commands we deal with in this chapter, requires
          that you explicitly list any filenames that you wish to
          resolve.  In any case, you want to be careful and use
          <command>svn resolve</command> only when you're certain that
          you've fixed the conflict in your file&#x2014;once the
          temporary files are removed, Subversion will let you commit
          the file even if it still contains conflict markers.</para>

        <para>If you ever get confused while editing the conflicted
          file, you can always consult the three files that Subversion
          creates for you in your working copy&#x2014;including your
          file as it was before you updated.  You can even use a
          third-party interactive merging tool to examine those three
          files.</para>

      <para>If you fail to specify either the

      <para>That covers the basic work cycle for using Subversion.
        Subversion offers many other features that you can use

      <para>Note that the log messages are printed in
        <emphasis>reverse chronological order</emphasis> by default.
        If you wish to see a different range of revisions in a
        particular order or just a single revision, pass the
        <option>--revision</option> (<option>-r</option>)
        option:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn log -r 5:19    # shows logs 5 through 19 in chronological order

$ svn log -r 19:5    # shows logs 5 through 19 in reverse order

$ svn log -r 8       # shows log for revision 8
</screen>

      <para>You can also examine the log history of a single file or
        directory.  For example:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn log foo.c
&#x2026;
$ svn log http://foo.com/svn/trunk/code/foo.c
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>These will display log messages <emphasis>only</emphasis>
        for those revisions in which the working file (or URL)
        changed.</para>

        <title>Why Does svn log Not Show Me What I
          Just Committed?</title>

        <para>If you make a commit and immediately type <userinput>svn
          log</userinput> with no arguments, you may notice that your
          most recent commit doesn't show up in the list of log
          messages.  This is due to a combination of the behavior of
          <command>svn commit</command> and the default behavior of
          <command>svn log</command>.  First, when you commit changes
          to the repository, <command>svn</command> bumps only the
          revision of files (and directories) that it commits, so
          usually the parent directory remains at the older revision
          (See
          <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit"/>
          for an explanation of why).  <command>svn log</command> then
          defaults to fetching the history of the directory at its
          current revision, and thus you don't see the newly committed
          changes.  The solution here is to either update your working
          copy or explicitly provide a revision number to <command>svn
          log</command> by using the <option>--revision</option>
          (<option>-r</option>) option.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>If you want even more information about a file or
        directory, <command>svn log</command> also takes a
        <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>) option.
        Because Subversion allows you to move and copy files and
        directories, it is important to be able to track path changes
        in the filesystem. So, in verbose mode, <command>svn
        log</command> will include a list of changed paths in a
        revision in its output:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn log -r 8 -v

   M /trunk/code/foo.c
   M /trunk/code/bar.h
   A /trunk/code/doc/README

Frozzled the sub-space winch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</screen>

      <para>
        <command>svn log</command> also takes a <option>--quiet</option>
        (<option>-q</option>) option, which suppresses the body of the
        log message.  When combined with <option>--verbose</option>, it
        gives just the names of the changed files.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Why Does svn log Give Me an Empty
          Response?</title>

        <para>After working with Subversion for a bit, most users will
          come across something like this:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn log -r 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$
</screen>

        <para>At first glance, this seems like an error.  But recall
          that while revisions are repository-wide, <command>svn
          log</command> operates on a path in the repository.  If you
          supply no path, Subversion uses the current working
          directory as the default target.  As a result, if you're
          operating in a subdirectory of your working copy and attempt
          to see the log of a revision in which neither that directory
          nor any of its children was changed, Subversion will show you
          an empty log.  If you want to see what changed in that
          revision, try pointing <command>svn log</command> directly at
          the topmost URL of your repository, as in <userinput>svn log -r 2
          http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn</userinput>.</para>

    <title>Sometimes You Just Need to Clean Up</title>

    <para>Now that we've covered the day-to-day tasks that you'll
      frequently use Subversion for, we'll review a few administrative
      tasks relating to your working copy.</para>


    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cleanup.disposal">

      <title>Disposing of a Working Copy</title>

      <para>Subversion doesn't track either the state or the existence of
        working copies on the server, so there's no server overhead to
        keeping working copies around.  Likewise, there's no need to
        let the server know that you're going to delete a working
        copy.</para>

      <para>If you're likely to use a working copy again, there's
        nothing wrong with just leaving it on disk until you're ready
        to use it again, at which point all it takes is an
        <command>svn update</command> to bring it up to date and ready
        for use.</para>

      <para>However, if you're definitely not going to use a working
        copy again, you can safely delete the entire thing, but you'd
        be well served to take a look through the working copy for
        unversioned files.  To find these files, run <userinput>svn
        status</userinput> and review any files that are prefixed with a
        <literal>?</literal> to make certain that they're not of
        importance.  After you're done reviewing, you can safely
        delete your working copy.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="svn.tour.cleanup.interruption">

      <title>Recovering from an Interruption</title>

      <para>When Subversion modifies your working copy (or any
        information within <filename>.svn</filename>), it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing the working copy,
        Subversion writes its intentions to a logfile.  Next, it
        executes the commands in the logfile to apply the requested
        change, holding a lock on the relevant part of the working
        copy while it works&#x2014;to prevent other Subversion clients
        from accessing the working copy mid-change.  Finally,
        Subversion removes the logfile.  Architecturally, this is
        similar to a journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation
        is interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the logfiles remain on disk.  By
        reexecuting the logfiles, Subversion can complete the
        previously started operation, and your working copy can get
        itself back into a consistent state.</para>

      <para>And this is exactly what <command>svn cleanup</command>
        does: it searches your working copy and runs any leftover
        logs, removing working copy locks in the process.
        If Subversion ever tells you that some part of your working copy
        is <quote>locked,</quote> this is the command that you
        should run.  Also, <command>svn status</command> will display
        an <literal>L</literal> next to locked items:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
  L    somedir
M      somedir/foo.c

$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M      somedir/foo.c
</screen>

      <para>Don't confuse these working copy locks with the ordinary
        locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent
        version control; see the sidebar
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.locking.meanings"/> for
        clarification.</para>

  <title>Advanced Topics</title>

  <para>If you've been reading this book chapter by chapter, from
    start to finish, you should by now have acquired enough
    knowledge to use the Subversion client to perform the most
    common version control operations.  You understand how to
    check out a working copy from a Subversion repository.  You are
    comfortable with submitting and receiving changes using the
    <command>svn commit</command> and <command>svn update</command>
    operations.  You've probably even developed a reflex that causes
    you to run the <command>svn status</command> command almost
    unconsciously.  For all intents and purposes, you are ready to
    use Subversion in a typical environment.</para>

  <para>But the Subversion feature set doesn't stop at <quote>common
    version control operations.</quote>  It has other bits of
    functionality besides just communicating file and
    directory changes to and from a central repository.</para>

  <para>This chapter highlights some of Subversion's features that,
    while important, aren't part of the typical user's daily routine.
    It assumes that you are familiar with Subversion's basic file and
    directory versioning capabilities.  If you aren't, you'll want to
    first read <xref linkend="svn.basic"/> and <xref linkend="svn.tour"/>.  Once you've mastered those basics and
    consumed this chapter, you'll be a Subversion power user!</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.tour.revs.specifiers">
    <title>Revision Specifiers</title>

    <para>As we described in <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.revs"/>, revision numbers in Subversion are pretty
      straightforward&#x2014;integers that keep getting larger as you
      commit more changes to your versioned data.  Still, it doesn't
      take long before you can no longer remember exactly what
      happened in each and every revision.  Fortunately, the typical
      Subversion workflow doesn't often demand that you supply
      arbitrary revisions to the Subversion operations you perform.
      For operations that <emphasis>do</emphasis> require a revision
      specifier, you generally supply a revision number that you saw
      in a commit email, in the output of some other Subversion
      operation, or in some other context that would give meaning to
      that particular number.</para>

    <para>But occasionally, you need to pinpoint a moment in time for
      which you don't already have a revision number memorized or
      handy.  So besides the integer revision numbers,
      <command>svn</command> allows as input some additional forms of
      revision specifiers: <firstterm>revision keywords</firstterm>
      and revision dates.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The various forms of Subversion revision specifiers can be
        mixed and matched when used to specify revision ranges.  For
        example, you can use <option>-r
        <replaceable>REV1</replaceable>:<replaceable>REV2</replaceable></option>
        where <replaceable>REV1</replaceable> is a revision keyword
        and <replaceable>REV2</replaceable> is a revision number, or
        where <replaceable>REV1</replaceable> is a date and
        <replaceable>REV2</replaceable> is a revision keyword, and so
        on.  The individual revision specifiers are independently
        evaluated, so you can put whatever you want on the opposite
        sides of that colon.</para>

      <para>The Subversion client understands a number of revision
        keywords.  These keywords can be used instead of integer
        arguments to the <option>--revision</option>
        (<option>-r</option>) option, and are resolved into specific
        revision numbers by Subversion:</para>

      <para>As can be derived from their descriptions, the

        when referring to a working copy path&#x2014;they don't apply
        to repository URLs.  <literal>HEAD</literal>, on the other

        <title>Is Subversion a Day Early?</title>
        
        <para>If you specify a single date as a revision without
          specifying a time of day (for example
          <literal>2006-11-27</literal>), you may think that Subversion
          should give you the last revision that took place on the
          27th of November.  Instead, you'll get back a revision from
          the 26th, or even earlier.  Remember that Subversion will
          find the <emphasis>most recent revision of the
          repository</emphasis> as of the date you give.  If you give
          a date without a timestamp, such as
          <literal>2006-11-27</literal>, Subversion assumes a time of
          00:00:00, so looking for the most recent revision won't
          return anything on the 27th.</para>

        <para>If you want to include the 27th in your search, you can
          either specify the 27th with the time (<literal>{"2006-11-27
          23:59"}</literal>), or just specify the next day
          (<literal>{2006-11-28}</literal>).</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Since the timestamp of a revision is stored as an
          unversioned, modifiable property of the revision (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props"/>), revision timestamps can be
          changed to represent complete falsifications of true
          chronology, or even removed altogether.  Subversion's
          ability to correctly convert revision dates into real
          revision numbers depends on revision datestamps maintaining
          a sequential ordering&#x2014;the younger the revision, the
          younger its timestamp.  If this ordering isn't maintained,
          you will likely find that trying to use dates to specify
          revision ranges in your repository doesn't always return the
          data you might have expected.</para>

    <title>Properties</title>
    <indexterm>
      <primary>properties</primary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>We've already covered in detail how Subversion stores and
      retrieves various versions of files and directories in its
      repository.  Whole chapters have been devoted to this most
      fundamental piece of functionality provided by the tool.  And
      if the versioning support stopped there, Subversion would still
      be complete from a version control perspective.</para>

    <para>But it doesn't stop there.</para>

    <para>In addition to versioning your directories and files,
      Subversion provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and
      removing versioned metadata on each of your versioned
      directories and files.  We refer to this metadata as
      <firstterm>properties</firstterm>, and they can be thought of as
      two-column tables that map property names to arbitrary values
      attached to each item in your working copy.  Generally speaking,
      the names and values of the properties can be whatever you want
      them to be, with the constraint that the names must contain only
      ASCII characters.  And the best part about these properties is
      that they, too, are versioned, just like the textual contents of
      your files.  You can modify, commit, and revert property changes
      as easily as you can file content changes.  And the sending and
      receiving of property changes occurs as part of your typical
      commit and update operations&#x2014;you don't have to change your
      basic processes to accommodate them.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Subversion has reserved the set of properties whose names
        begin with <literal>svn:</literal> as its own.  While there
        are only a handful of such properties in use today, you should
        avoid creating custom properties for your own needs whose names
        begin with this prefix.  Otherwise, you run the risk that a
        future release of Subversion will grow support for a feature
        or behavior driven by a property of the same name but with
        perhaps an entirely different interpretation.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too.  Just as
      files and directories may have arbitrary property names and
      values attached to them, each revision as a whole may have
      arbitrary properties attached to it.  The same constraints
      apply&#x2014;human-readable names and anything-you-want binary
      values.  The main difference is that revision properties are not
      versioned.  In other words, if you change the value of, or
      delete, a revision property, there's no way, within the scope of
      Subversion's functionality, to recover the previous value.</para>

    <para>Subversion has no particular policy regarding the use of
      properties.  It asks only that you not use property names that
      begin with the prefix <literal>svn:</literal>.  That's the
      namespace that it sets aside for its own use.  And Subversion
      does, in fact, use properties&#x2014;both the versioned and
      unversioned variety.  Certain versioned properties have special
      meaning or effects when found on files and directories, or they
      house a particular bit of information about the revisions on
      which they are found.  Certain revision properties are
      automatically attached to revisions by Subversion's commit
      process, and they carry information about the revision.  Most of
      these properties are mentioned elsewhere in this or other
      chapters as part of the more general topics to which they are
      related.  For an exhaustive list of Subversion's predefined
      properties, see <xref linkend="svn.ref.properties"/>.</para>

    <para>In this section, we will examine the utility&#x2014;both to
      users of Subversion and to Subversion itself&#x2014;of property
      support.  You'll learn about the property-related
      <command>svn</command> subcommands and how property
      modifications affect your normal Subversion workflow.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.why">
      <title>Why Properties?</title>

      <para>Just as Subversion uses properties to store extra
        information about the files, directories, and revisions that
        it contains, you might also find properties to be of similar
        use.  You might find it useful to have a place
        close to your versioned data to hang custom metadata about
        that data.</para>

      <para>Say you wish to design a web site that houses many digital
        photos and displays them with captions and a datestamp.  Now,
        your set of photos is constantly changing, so you'd like to
        have as much of this site automated as possible.  These photos
        can be quite large, so as is common with sites of this nature,
        you want to provide smaller thumbnail images to your site
        visitors.</para>

      <para>Now, you can get this functionality using traditional
        files.  That is, you can have your
        <filename>image123.jpg</filename> and an
        <filename>image123-thumbnail.jpg</filename> side by side in a
        directory.  Or if you want to keep the filenames the same, you
        might have your thumbnails in a different directory, such as
        <filename>thumbnails/image123.jpg</filename>.  You can also
        store your captions and datestamps in a similar fashion, again
        separated from the original image file.  But the problem here
        is that your collection of files multiplies with each new
        photo added to the site.</para>

      <para>Now consider the same web site deployed in a way that
        makes use of Subversion's file properties.  Imagine having a
        single image file, <filename>image123.jpg</filename>, with
        properties set on that file that are named
        <literal>caption</literal>, <literal>datestamp</literal>, and
        even <literal>thumbnail</literal>.  Now your working copy
        directory looks much more manageable&#x2014;in fact, it looks
        to the casual browser like there are nothing but image files
        in it.  But your automation scripts know better.  They know
        that they can use <command>svn</command> (or better yet, they
        can use the Subversion language bindings&#x2014;see <xref linkend="svn.developer.usingapi"/>) to dig out the extra
        information that your site needs to display without having to
        read an index file or play path manipulation games.</para>

      <note>
        <para>While Subversion places few restrictions on the names
          and values you use for properties, it has not been designed
          to optimally carry large property values or large sets of
          properties on a given file or directory.  Subversion
          commonly holds all the property names and values associated
          with a single item in memory at the same time, which can
          cause detrimental performance or failed operations when
          extremely large property sets are used.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Custom revision properties are also frequently used.  One
        common such use is a property whose value contains an issue
        tracker ID with which the revision is associated, perhaps
        because the change made in that revision fixes a bug filed in
        the tracker issue with that ID.  Other uses include hanging
        more friendly names on the revision&#x2014;it might be hard to
        remember that revision 1935 was a fully tested revision.  But
        if there's, say, a <literal>test-results</literal> property on
        that revision with the value <literal>all passing</literal>,
        that's meaningful information to have.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Searchability (or, Why <emphasis>Not</emphasis>
          Properties)</title>

        <para>For all their utility, Subversion properties&#x2014;or,
          more accurately, the available interfaces to them&#x2014;have
          a major shortcoming: while it is a simple matter to
          <emphasis>set</emphasis> a custom property,
          <emphasis>finding</emphasis> that property later is a whole
          different ball of wax.</para>

        <para>Trying to locate a custom revision property generally
          involves performing a linear walk across all the revisions
          of the repository, asking of each revision, "Do you have the
          property I'm looking for?"  Trying to find a custom
          versioned property is painful, too, and often involves a
          recursive <command>svn propget</command> across an entire
          working copy.  In your situation, that might not be as bad
          as a linear walk across all revisions.  But it certainly
          leaves much to be desired in terms of both performance and
          likelihood of success, especially if the scope of your
          search would require a working copy from the root of your
          repository.</para>

        <para>For this reason, you might choose&#x2014;especially in
          the revision property use case&#x2014;to simply add your
          metadata to the revision's log message using some
          policy-driven (and perhaps programmatically enforced)
          formatting that is designed to be quickly parsed from the
          output of <command>svn log</command>.  It is quite common to
          see the following in Subversion log messages:</para>

        <programlisting>
Issue(s): IZ2376, IZ1919
Reviewed by:  sally

This fixes a nasty segfault in the wort frabbing process
&#x2026;
</programlisting>

        <para>But here again lies some misfortune.  Subversion doesn't
          yet provide a log message templating mechanism, which would
          go a long way toward helping users be consistent with the
          formatting of their log-embedded revision metadata.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.manip">
      <title>Manipulating Properties</title>

      <para>The <command>svn</command> program affords a few ways to
        add or modify file and directory properties.  For properties
        with short, human-readable values, perhaps the simplest way to
        add a new property is to specify the property name and value
        on the command line of the <command>svn propset</command>
        subcommand:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/button.c
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</screen>
       
      <para>But we've been touting the flexibility that Subversion
        offers for your property values.  And if you are planning to
        have a multiline textual, or even binary, property value, you
        probably do not want to supply that value on the command line.
        So the <command>svn propset</command> subcommand takes a
        <option>--file</option> (<option>-F</option>) option for
        specifying the name of a file that contains the new property
        value.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset license -F /path/to/LICENSE calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</screen>

      <para>There are some restrictions on the names you can use for
        properties.  A property name must start with a letter, a colon
        (<literal>:</literal>), or an underscore
        (<literal>_</literal>); after that, you can also use digits,
        hyphens (<literal>-</literal>), and periods
        (<literal>.</literal>).
          <footnote>
            <para>If you're familiar with XML, this is pretty much the
            ASCII subset of the syntax for XML "Name".</para>
          </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>In addition to the <command>propset</command> command, the
        <command>svn</command> program supplies the
        <command>propedit</command> command.  This command uses the
        configured editor program (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config"/>) to add or
        modify properties.  When you run the command,
        <command>svn</command> invokes your editor program on a
        temporary file that contains the current value of the property
        (or that is empty, if you are adding a new property).  Then,
        you just modify that value in your editor program until it
        represents the new value you wish to store for the property,
        save the temporary file, and then exit the editor program.  If
        Subversion detects that you've actually changed the existing
        value of the property, it will accept that as the new property
        value.  If you exit your editor without making any changes, no
        property modification will occur:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propedit copyright calc/button.c  ### exit the editor without changes
No changes to property 'copyright' on 'calc/button.c'
$
</screen>

      <para>We should note that, as with other <command>svn</command>
        subcommands, those related to properties can act on multiple
        paths at once.  This enables you to modify properties on whole
        sets of files with a single command.  For example, we could
        have done the following:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/*
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/Makefile'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/integer.c'
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>All of this property adding and editing isn't really very
        useful if you can't easily get the stored property value.  So
        the <command>svn</command> program supplies two subcommands
        for displaying the names and values of properties stored on
        files and directories.  The <command>svn proplist</command>
        command will list the names of properties that exist on a
        path.  Once you know the names of the properties on the node,
        you can request their values individually using <command>svn
        propget</command>.  This command will, given a property name and a path (or set of
        paths), print the value of the property to
        the standard output stream.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn proplist calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright
  license
$ svn propget copyright calc/button.c
(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software
</screen>

      <para>There's even a variation of the
        <command>proplist</command> command that will list both the
        name and the value for all of the properties.  Simply supply the
        <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>) option.</para>

      <screen>

      <para>The last property-related subcommand is
        <command>propdel</command>.  Since Subversion allows you to
        store properties with empty values, you can't remove a
        property altogether using <command>svn propedit</command> or
        <command>svn propset</command>.  For example, this command will
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> yield the desired effect:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset license '' calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software

</screen>

      <para>You need to use the <command>propdel</command> subcommand
        to delete properties altogether.  The syntax is similar to the
        other property commands:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propdel license calc/button.c
property 'license' deleted from 'calc/button.c'.
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':

</screen>

      <para>Remember those unversioned revision properties?  You can
        modify those, too, using the same <command>svn</command>
        subcommands that we just described.  Simply add the
        <option>--revprop</option> command-line parameter and specify
        the revision whose property you wish to modify.  Since
        revisions are global, you don't need to specify a target path
        to these property-related commands so long as you are
        positioned in a working copy of the repository whose
        revision property you wish to modify.  Otherwise, you can
        simply provide the URL of any path in the repository of
        interest (including the repository's root URL).  For example,
        you might want to replace the commit log message of an
        existing revision.
        <footnote>
          <para>Fixing spelling errors, grammatical gotchas, and
            <quote>just-plain-wrongness</quote> in commit log
            messages is perhaps the most common use case for the
            <option>--revprop</option> option.</para>
        </footnote>
        If your current working directory is part of a working copy of
        your repository, you can simply run the
        <command>svn propset</command> command with no target path:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</screen>

      <para>But even if you haven't checked out a working copy from
        that repository, you can still effect the property change by
        providing the repository's root URL:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop \
              http://svn.example.com/repos/project
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</screen>

      <para>Note that the ability to modify these unversioned
        properties must be explicitly added by the repository
        administrator (see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.setlog"/>).
        That's because the properties aren't versioned, so you run the risk of
        losing information if you aren't careful with your edits.
        The repository administrator can set up methods to protect
        against this loss, and by default, modification of
        unversioned properties is disabled.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Users should, where possible, use <command>svn
          propedit</command> instead of <command>svn
          propset</command>.  While the end result of the commands is
          identical, the former will allow them to see the current
          value of the property that they are about to change, which helps
          them to verify that they are, in fact, making the change
          they think they are making.  This is especially true when
          modifying unversioned revision properties.  Also, it is
          significantly easier to modify multiline property values in
          a text editor than at the command line.</para>

      <title>Properties and the Subversion Workflow</title>

      <para>Now that you are familiar with all of the
        property-related <command>svn</command> subcommands, let's see
        how property modifications affect the usual Subversion
        workflow.  As we mentioned earlier, file and directory
        properties are versioned, just like your file contents.  As a
        result, Subversion provides the same opportunities for
        merging&#x2014;cleanly or with conflicts&#x2014;someone
        else's modifications into your own.</para>

      <para>As with file contents, your property changes are local
        modifications, made permanent only when you commit them to the
        repository with <command>svn commit</command>.  Your property
        changes can be easily unmade, too&#x2014;the <command>svn
        revert</command> command will restore your files and
        directories to their unedited states&#x2014;contents, properties,
        and all.  Also, you can receive interesting information about
        the state of your file and directory properties by using the
        <command>svn status</command> and <command>svn diff</command>
        commands.</para>

      <para>Notice how the <command>status</command> subcommand
        displays <literal>M</literal> in the second column instead of
        the first.  That is because we have modified the properties on
        <filename>calc/button.c</filename>, but not its textual
        contents.  Had we changed both, we would have seen
        <literal>M</literal> in the first column, too.  (We cover
        <command>svn status</command> in <xref linkend="svn.tour.cycle.examine.status"/>).</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Property Conflicts</title>

        <para>As with file contents, local property modifications can
          conflict with changes committed by someone else.  If you
          update your working copy directory and receive property
          changes on a versioned object that clash with your own,
          Subversion will report that the object is in a conflicted
          state.</para>
 
        <screen>
$ svn update calc

$ 
</screen>
         
        <para>Subversion will also create, in the same directory as
          the conflicted object, a file with a
          <filename>.prej</filename> extension that contains the
          details of the conflict.  You should examine the contents of
          this file so you can decide how to resolve the conflict.
          Until the conflict is resolved, you will see a
          <literal>C</literal> in the second column of <command>svn
          status</command> output for that object, and attempts to
          commit your local modifications will fail.</para>

        <screen>

$
</screen>
 
        <para>To resolve property conflicts, simply ensure that the
          conflicting properties contain the values that they should,
          and then use the <command>svn resolved</command> command to
          alert Subversion that you have manually resolved the
          problem.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>You might also have noticed the nonstandard way that
        Subversion currently displays property differences.  You can
        still use <command>svn diff</command> and redirect its output
        to create a usable patch file.  The <command>patch</command>
        program will ignore property patches&#x2014;as a rule, it
        ignores any noise it can't understand.  This does,
        unfortunately, mean that to fully apply a patch generated by
        <command>svn diff</command>, any property modifications will
        need to be applied by hand.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.auto">
      <title>Automatic Property Setting</title>

      <para>Properties are a powerful feature of Subversion, acting as
        key components of many Subversion features discussed elsewhere
        in this and other chapters&#x2014;textual diff and merge
        support, keyword substitution, newline translation, and so on.  But
        to get the full benefit of properties, they must be set on the
        right files and directories.  Unfortunately, that
        step can be easily forgotten in the routine of things, especially
        since failing to set a property doesn't usually result in an
        obvious error (at least compared to, say, failing to
        add a file to version control).  To help your properties get
        applied to the places that need them, Subversion provides a
        couple of simple but useful features.</para>

      <para>Whenever you introduce a file to version control using the
        <command>svn add</command> or <command>svn import</command>
        commands, Subversion tries to assist by setting some common
        file properties automatically.  First, on operating systems
        whose filesystems support an execute permission bit,
        Subversion will automatically set the
        <literal>svn:executable</literal> property on newly added or
        imported files whose execute bit is enabled.  (See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.executable"/> later in
        this chapter for more about this property.)</para>

      <para>Second, Subversion tries to determine the file's MIME
        type.  If you've configured a
        <literal>mime-types-files</literal> runtime configuration
        parameter, Subversion will try to find a MIME type mapping in
        that file for your file's extension.  If it finds such a
        mapping, it will set your file's
        <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to the MIME type it
        found.  If no mapping file is configured, or no mapping for
        your file's extension could be found, Subversion runs a very
        basic heuristic to determine whether the file contains nontextual
        content.  If so, it automatically sets the
        <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on that file to
        <literal>application/octet-stream</literal> (the generic
        <quote>this is a collection of bytes</quote> MIME type).  Of
        course, if Subversion guesses incorrectly, or if you wish to
        set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to something
        more precise&#x2014;perhaps <literal>image/png</literal> or
        <literal>application/x-shockwave-flash</literal>&#x2014;you can
        always remove or edit that property.  (For more on
        Subversion's use of MIME types, see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/> later in
        this chapter.)</para>

      <para>Subversion also provides, via its runtime configuration
        system (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>), a more
        flexible automatic property setting feature that allows you
        to create mappings of filename patterns to property names and
        values.  Once again, these mappings affect adds and imports,
        and can not only override the default MIME type decision made
        by Subversion during those operations, but can also set
        additional Subversion or custom properties, too.  For example,
        you might create a mapping that says that anytime you add
        JPEG files&#x2014;ones whose names match the pattern
        <literal>*.jpg</literal>&#x2014;Subversion should automatically
        set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on those
        files to <literal>image/jpeg</literal>.  Or perhaps any files
        that match <literal>*.cpp</literal> should have
        <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> set to
        <literal>native</literal>, and <literal>svn:keywords</literal>
        set to <literal>Id</literal>.  Automatic property support is
        perhaps the handiest property-related tool in the Subversion
        toolbox.  See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config"/> for more about
        configuring that support.</para>

    <title>File Portability</title>

    <para>Fortunately for Subversion users who routinely find
      themselves on different computers with different operating
      systems, Subversion's command-line program behaves almost
      identically on all those systems.  If you know how to wield
      <command>svn</command> on one platform, you know how to wield it
      everywhere.</para>

    <para>However, the same is not always true of other general classes
      of software or of the actual files you keep in Subversion.  For
      example, on a Windows machine, the definition of a <quote>text
      file</quote> would be similar to that used on a Linux box, but
      with a key difference&#x2014;the character sequences used to mark
      the ends of the lines of those files.  There are other
      differences, too.  Unix platforms have (and Subversion supports)
      symbolic links; Windows does not.  Unix platforms use filesystem
      permission to determine executability; Windows uses filename
      extensions.</para>

    <para>Because Subversion is in no position to unite the whole
      world in common definitions and implementations of all of these
      things, the best it can do is to try to help make your life
      simpler when you need to work with your versioned files and
      directories on multiple computers and operating systems.  This
      section describes some of the ways Subversion does this.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type">
      <title>File Content Type</title>
      
      <para>Subversion joins the ranks of the many applications that
        recognize and make use of Multipurpose Internet Mail
        Extensions (MIME) content types.  Besides being a
        general-purpose storage location for a file's content type,
        the value of the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> file
        property determines some behavioral characteristics of
        Subversion itself.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Identifying File Types</title>
    
        <para>Various programs on most modern operating systems make
          assumptions about the type and format of the contents of a
          file by the file's name, specifically its file extension.
          For example, files whose names end in
          <filename>.txt</filename> are generally assumed to be
          human-readable; that is, able to be understood by simple perusal
          rather than requiring complex processing to decipher.  Files
          whose names end in <filename>.png</filename>, on the other
          hand, are assumed to be of the Portable Network Graphics
          type&#x2014;not human-readable at all, and sensible only when
          interpreted by software that understands the PNG format and
          can render the information in that format as a raster
          image.</para>

        <para>Unfortunately, some of those extensions have changed
          their meanings over time.  When personal computers first appeared,
          a file named <filename>README.DOC</filename> would have
          almost certainly been a plain-text file, just like today's
          <filename>.txt</filename> files.  But by the mid-1990s, you
          could almost bet that a file of that name would not be a
          plain-text file at all, but instead a Microsoft Word document
          in a proprietary, non-human-readable format.  But this
          change didn't occur overnight&#x2014;there was certainly a
          period of confusion for computer users over what exactly
          they had in hand when they saw a <filename>.DOC</filename>
          file.
          <footnote>
            <para>You think that was rough?  During that same era,
              WordPerfect also used <filename>.DOC</filename> for their
              proprietary file format's preferred extension!</para>
          </footnote>
        </para>

        <para>The popularity of computer networking cast still more
          doubt on the mapping between a file's name and its content.
          With information being served across networks and generated
          dynamically by server-side scripts, there was often no real
          file per se, and therefore no filename.  Web
          servers, for example, needed some other way to tell browsers
          what they were downloading so that the browser could do something
          intelligent with that information, whether that was to
          display the data using a program registered to handle that
          datatype or to prompt the user for where on the client
          machine to store the downloaded data.</para>

        <para>Eventually, a standard emerged for, among other things,
          describing the contents of a data stream.  In 1996, RFC 2045
          was published.  It was the first of five RFCs describing
          MIME.  It describes the concept of media types and subtypes
          and recommends a syntax for the representation of those
          types.  Today, MIME media types&#x2014;or <quote>MIME
          types</quote>&#x2014;are used almost universally across
          email applications, web servers, and other software as the
          de facto mechanism for clearing up the file content
          confusion.</para>

      </sidebar>
    
      <para>For example, one of the benefits that Subversion typically
        provides is contextual, line-based merging of changes received
        from the server during an update into your working file.  But
        for files containing nontextual data, there is often no
        concept of a <quote>line.</quote>  So, for versioned files
        whose <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property is set to a
        nontextual MIME type (generally, something that doesn't begin
        with <literal>text/</literal>, though there are exceptions),
        Subversion does not attempt to perform contextual merges
        during updates.  Instead, any time you have locally modified a
        binary working copy file that is also being updated, your file
        is left untouched and Subversion creates two new files.  One
        file has a <filename>.oldrev</filename> extension and contains
        the BASE revision of the file.  The other file has a
        <filename>.newrev</filename> extension and contains the
        contents of the updated revision of the file.  This behavior
        is really for the protection of the user against failed
        attempts at performing contextual merges on files that simply
        cannot be contextually merged.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>The <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property, when set
          to a value that does not indicate textual file contents, can
          cause some unexpected behaviors with respect to other
          properties.  For example, since the idea of line endings
          (and therefore, line-ending conversion) makes no sense when
          applied to nontextual files, Subversion will prevent you
          from setting the <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property
          on such files.  This is obvious when attempted on a single
          file target&#x2014;<command>svn propset</command> will error
          out.  But it might not be as clear if you perform a
          recursive property set, where Subversion will silently skip
          over files that it deems unsuitable for a given
          property.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Beginning in Subversion 1.5, users can configure a new
        <literal>mime-types-file</literal> runtime configuration
        parameter, which identifies the location of a MIME types
        mapping file.  Subversion will consult this mapping file to
        determine the MIME type of newly added and imported
        files.</para>

      <para>Also, if the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property is
        set, then the Subversion Apache module will use its value to
        populate the <literal>Content-type:</literal> HTTP header when
        responding to GET requests.  This gives your web browser a
        crucial clue about how to display a file when you use it to
        peruse your Subversion repository's contents.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.props.special.executable">
      <title>File Executability</title>
 
      <para>On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file
        as a command is governed by the presence of an execute
        permission bit.  This bit usually defaults to being disabled,
        and must be explicitly enabled by the user for each file that
        needs it.  But it would be a monumental hassle to have to
        remember exactly which files in a freshly checked-out working
        copy were supposed to have their executable bits toggled on,
        and then to have to do that toggling.  So, Subversion provides
        the <literal>svn:executable</literal> property as a way to
        specify that the executable bit for the file on which that
        property is set should be enabled, and Subversion honors that
        request when populating working copies with such files.</para>

      <para>This property has no effect on filesystems that have no
        concept of an executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and
        NTFS.
        <footnote>
          <para>The Windows filesystems use file extensions (such as
            <filename>.EXE</filename>, <filename>.BAT</filename>, and
            <filename>.COM</filename>) to denote executable
            files.</para>
        </footnote>
        Also, although it has no defined values, Subversion will force
        its value to <literal>*</literal> when setting this property.
        Finally, this property is valid only on files, not on
        directories.</para>

      <para>Unless otherwise noted using a versioned file's
        <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property, Subversion
        assumes the file contains human-readable data.  Generally
        speaking, Subversion uses this knowledge only to determine
        whether contextual difference reports for that file are
        possible.  Otherwise, to Subversion, bytes are bytes.</para>
      
      <para>This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any
        attention to the type of <firstterm>end-of-line (EOL)
        markers</firstterm> used in your files.  Unfortunately,
        different operating systems have different conventions about
        which character sequences represent the end of a line of text
        in a file.  For example, the usual line-ending token used by
        software on the Windows platform is a pair of ASCII control
        characters&#x2014;a carriage return (<literal>CR</literal>)
        followed by a line feed (<literal>LF</literal>).  Unix
        software, however, just uses the <literal>LF</literal>
        character to denote the end of a line.</para>

      <para>Not all of the various tools on these operating systems
        understand files that contain line endings in a format that
        differs from the <firstterm>native line-ending
        style</firstterm> of the operating system on which they are
        running.  So, typically, Unix programs treat the
        <literal>CR</literal> character present in Windows files as a
        regular character (usually rendered as <literal>^M</literal>),
        and Windows programs combine all of the lines of a Unix file
        into one giant line because no carriage return-linefeed (or
        <literal>CRLF</literal>) character combination was found to
        denote the ends of the lines.</para>

      <para>This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can be
        frustrating for folks who share a file across different
        operating systems.  For example, consider a source code
        file, and developers that edit this file on both Windows and
        Unix systems.  If all the developers always use tools that
        preserve the line-ending style of the file, no problems
        occur.</para>

      <para>But in practice, many common tools either fail to
        properly read a file with foreign EOL markers, or
        convert the file's line endings to the native style when the
        file is saved.  If the former is true for a developer, he
        has to use an external conversion utility (such as
        <command>dos2unix</command> or its companion,
        <command>unix2dos</command>) to prepare the file for
        editing.  The latter case requires no extra preparation.
        But both cases result in a file that differs from the
        original quite literally on every line!  Prior to committing
        his changes, the user has two choices.  Either he can use a
        conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
        line-ending style that it was in before his edits were made,
        or he can simply commit the file&#x2014;new EOL markers and
        all.</para>

      <para>The result of scenarios like these include wasted time
        and unnecessary modifications to committed files.  Wasted
        time is painful enough.  But when commits change every line
        in a file, this complicates the job of determining which of
        those lines were changed in a nontrivial way.  Where was
        that bug really fixed?  On what line was a syntax error
        introduced?</para>

      <para>The solution to this problem is the
        <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property.  When this
        property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to
        determine what special processing to perform on the file so
        that the file's line-ending style isn't flip-flopping with
        every commit that comes from a different operating
        system.  The valid values are:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>native</literal></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This causes the file to contain the EOL markers
              that are native to the operating system on which
              Subversion was run.  In other words, if a user on a
              Windows machine checks out a working copy that
              contains a file with an
              <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> property set to
              <literal>native</literal>, that file will contain
              <literal>CRLF</literal> EOL markers.  A Unix user
              checking out a working copy that contains the same
              file will see <literal>LF</literal> EOL markers in his
              copy of the file.</para>

            <para>Note that Subversion will actually store the file
              in the repository using normalized
              <literal>LF</literal> EOL markers regardless of the
              operating system.  This is basically transparent to
              the user, though.</para>
          </listitem>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>CRLF</literal></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>This causes the file to contain
              <literal>CRLF</literal> sequences for EOL markers,

    <title>Ignoring Unversioned Items</title>

    <para>In any given working copy, there is a good chance that
      alongside all those versioned files and directories are other
      files and directories that are neither versioned nor intended
      to be.  Text editors litter directories with backup files.
      Software compilers generate intermediate&#x2014;or even
      final&#x2014;files that you typically wouldn't bother to
      version.  And users themselves drop various other files and
      directories wherever they see fit, often in version control
      working copies.</para>

    <para>It's ludicrous to expect Subversion working copies to be
      somehow impervious to this kind of clutter and impurity.  In
      fact, Subversion counts it as a <emphasis>feature</emphasis>
      that its working copies are just typical directories, just like
      unversioned trees.  But these not-to-be-versioned files and
      directories can cause some annoyance for Subversion users.  For
      example, because the <command>svn add</command> and <command>svn
      import</command> commands act recursively by default and don't
      know which files in a given tree you do and don't wish to
      version, it's easy to accidentally add stuff to version control
      that you didn't mean to.  And because <command>svn
      status</command> reports, by default, every item of interest in
      a working copy&#x2014;including unversioned files and
      directories&#x2014;its output can get quite noisy where many of
      these things exist.</para>

    <para>So Subversion provides two ways for telling it which files
      you would prefer that it simply disregard.  One of the ways
      involves the use of Subversion's runtime configuration system
      (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>), and therefore
      applies to all the Subversion operations that make use of that
      runtime configuration&#x2014;generally those performed on a particular
      computer or by a particular user of a computer.  The other way
      makes use of Subversion's directory property support and is more
      tightly bound to the versioned tree itself, and therefore
      affects everyone who has a working copy of that tree.  Both of
      the mechanisms use <firstterm>file patterns</firstterm> (strings
      of literal and special wildcard characters used to match against
      filenames) to decide which files to ignore.</para>

    <para>The Subversion runtime configuration system provides an
      option, <literal>global-ignores</literal>, whose value is a
      whitespace-delimited collection of file patterns.  The
      Subversion client checks these patterns against the names of the
      files that are candidates for addition to version control, as
      well as to unversioned files that the <command>svn
      status</command> command notices.  If any file's name matches
      one of the patterns, Subversion will basically act as if the
      file didn't exist at all.  This is really useful for the kinds
      of files that you almost never want to version, such as editor
      backup files such as Emacs' <literal>*~</literal> and
      <literal>.*~</literal> files.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>File Patterns in Subversion</title>

      <para>File patterns (also called <firstterm>globs</firstterm> or
        <firstterm>shell wildcard patterns</firstterm>) are strings of
        characters that are intended to be matched against filenames,
        typically for the purpose of quickly selecting some subset of
        similar files from a larger grouping without having to
        explicitly name each file.  The patterns contain two types of
        characters:  regular characters, which are compared explicitly
        against potential matches, and special wildcard characters,
        which are interpreted differently for matching
        purposes.</para>

      <para>There are different types of file pattern syntaxes, but
        Subversion uses the one most commonly found in Unix systems
        implemented as the <function>fnmatch</function> system
        function.  It supports the following wildcards, described here
        simply for your convenience:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>?</literal></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Matches any single character</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>*</literal></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Matches any string of characters, including the
              empty string</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>[</literal></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Begins a character class definition terminated by
              <literal>]</literal>, used for matching a subset of
              characters</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>You can see this same pattern matching behavior at a Unix
        shell prompt.  The following are some examples of patterns
        being used for various things:</para>

      <para>File pattern matching is a bit more complex than what
        we've described here, but this basic usage level tends to suit
        the majority of Subversion users.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>When found on a versioned directory, the
      <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property is expected to contain a
      list of newline-delimited file patterns that Subversion should
      use to determine ignorable objects in that same directory.
      These patterns do not override those found in the
      <literal>global-ignores</literal> runtime configuration option,
      but are instead appended to that list.  And it's worth noting
      again that, unlike the <literal>global-ignores</literal> option,
      the patterns found in the <literal>svn:ignore</literal>
      property apply only to the directory on which that property is
      set, and not to any of its subdirectories.  The
      <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property is a good way to tell
      Subversion to ignore files that are likely to be present in
      every user's working copy of that directory, such as compiler
      output or&#x2014;to use an example more appropriate to this
      book&#x2014;the HTML, PDF, or PostScript files generated as the
      result of a conversion of some source DocBook XML files to a
      more legible output format.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Subversion's support for ignorable file patterns extends
        only to the one-time process of adding unversioned
        files and directories to version control.  Once an object is
        under Subversion's control, the ignore pattern mechanisms no
        longer apply to it.  In other words, don't expect Subversion
        to avoid committing changes you've made to a versioned file
        simply because that file's name matches an ignore
        pattern&#x2014;Subversion <emphasis>always</emphasis> notices
        all of its versioned objects.</para>
    </note>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Ignore Patterns for CVS Users</title>
    
      <para>The Subversion <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property is
        very similar in syntax and function to the CVS
        <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file.  In fact, if you are
        migrating a CVS working copy to Subversion, you can directly
        migrate the ignore patterns by using the
        <filename>.cvsignore</filename> file as input file to the
        <command>svn propset</command> command:</para>
   
      <screen>
$ svn propset svn:ignore -F .cvsignore .
property 'svn:ignore' set on '.'
$
</screen>        
    
      <para>There are, however, some differences in the ways that CVS
        and Subversion handle ignore patterns.  The two systems use
        the ignore patterns at some different times, and there are
        slight discrepancies in what the ignore patterns apply to.
        Also, Subversion does not recognize the use of the
        <literal>!</literal> pattern as a reset back to having no
        ignore patterns at all.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>The global list of ignore patterns tends to be more a
      matter of personal taste and ties more closely to a user's
      particular tool chain than to the details of any particular
      working copy's needs.  So, the rest of this section will focus
      on the <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property and its
      uses.</para>

    <para>Say you have the following output from <command>svn
      status</command>:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn status calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
?      calc/debug_log
?      calc/debug_log.1
?      calc/debug_log.2.gz
?      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</screen>
    
    <para>In this example, you have made some property modifications
      to <filename>button.c</filename>, but in your working copy, you
      also have some unversioned files: the latest
      <filename>calculator</filename> program that you've compiled
      from your source code, a source file named
      <filename>data.c</filename>, and a set of debugging output logfiles.
      Now, you know that your build system always results in
      the <filename>calculator</filename> program being generated.
      <footnote>
        <para>Isn't that the whole point of a build system?</para>
      </footnote>
      And you know that your test suite always leaves those debugging
      logfiles lying around.  These facts are true for all working
      copies of this project, not just your own.  And you know that
      you aren't interested in seeing those things every time you run
      <command>svn status</command>, and you are pretty sure that
      nobody else is interested in them either.  So you use
      <userinput>svn propedit svn:ignore calc</userinput> to add some
      ignore patterns to the <filename>calc</filename> directory.  For
      example, you might add this as the new value of the
      <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property:</para>

    <programlisting>
calculator
debug_log*
</programlisting>
    
    <para>After you've added this property, you will now have a local
      property modification on the <filename>calc</filename>
      directory.  But notice what else is different about your
      <command>svn status</command> output:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn status
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
?      calc/data.c
</screen>
    
    <para>Now, all that cruft is missing from the output!  Your
      <filename>calculator</filename> compiled program and all those
      logfiles are still in your working copy; Subversion just isn't
      constantly reminding you that they are present and unversioned.
      And now with all the uninteresting noise removed from the
      display, you are left with more intriguing items&#x2014;such as
      that source code file <filename>data.c</filename> that you
      probably forgot to add to version control.</para>

    <para>Of course, this less-verbose report of your working copy
      status isn't the only one available.  If you actually want to
      see the ignored files as part of the status report, you can pass
      the <option>--no-ignore</option> option to Subversion:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn status --no-ignore
 M     calc
 M     calc/button.c
I      calc/calculator
?      calc/data.c
I      calc/debug_log
I      calc/debug_log.1
I      calc/debug_log.2.gz
I      calc/debug_log.3.gz
</screen>
    
    <para>As mentioned earlier, the list of file patterns to ignore is
      also used by <command>svn add</command> and <command>svn
      import</command>.  Both of these operations involve asking
      Subversion to begin managing some set of files and directories.
      Rather than force the user to pick and choose which files in a
      tree she wishes to start versioning, Subversion uses the ignore
      patterns&#x2014;both the global and the per-directory
      lists&#x2014;to determine which files should not be swept into
      the version control system as part of a larger recursive
      addition or import operation.  And here again, you can use the
      <option>--no-ignore</option> option to tell Subversion ignore
      its ignores list and operate on all the files and directories
      present.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Even if <literal>svn:ignore</literal> is set, you may run
        into problems if you use shell wildcards in a command.  Shell
        wildcards are expanded into an explicit list of targets before
        Subversion operates on them, so running <userinput>svn
        <replaceable>SUBCOMMAND</replaceable> *</userinput> is just like
        running <userinput>svn <replaceable>SUBCOMMAND</replaceable>
        file1 file2 file3 &#x2026;</userinput>.  In the case of the
        <command>svn add</command> command, this has an effect similar
        to passing the <option>--no-ignore</option> option.  So
        instead of using a wildcard, use <userinput>svn add --force
        .</userinput> to do a bulk scheduling of unversioned things for
        addition.  The explicit target will ensure that the current
        directory isn't overlooked because of being already under
        version control, and the <option>--force</option> option will
        cause Subversion to crawl through that directory, adding
        unversioned files while still honoring the
        <literal>svn:ignore</literal> property and
        <literal>global-ignores</literal> runtime configuration
        variable.  Be sure to also provide the <option>--depth
        files</option> option to the <command>svn add</command>
        command if you don't want a fully recursive crawl for things
        to add.</para>

    <title>Keyword Substitution</title>

    <para>Subversion has the ability to substitute
      <firstterm>keywords</firstterm>&#x2014;pieces of useful,
      dynamic information about a versioned file&#x2014;into the
      contents of the file itself.  Keywords generally provide
      information about the last modification made to the file.
      Because this information changes each time the
      file changes, and more importantly, just
      <emphasis>after</emphasis> the file changes, it is a hassle
      for any process except the version control system to keep
      the data completely up to date.  Left to human authors, the
      information would inevitably grow stale.</para>

    <para>For example, say you have a document in which you would
      like to display the last date on which it was modified.  You
      could burden every author of that document to, just before
      committing their changes, also tweak the part of the
      document that describes when it was last changed.  But
      sooner or later, someone would forget to do that.  Instead,
      simply ask Subversion to perform keyword substitution on the
      <literal>LastChangedDate</literal> keyword.  You control
      where the keyword is inserted into your document by placing
      a <firstterm>keyword anchor</firstterm> at the desired
      location in the file.  This anchor is just a string of text
      formatted as
      <literal>$</literal><replaceable>KeywordName</replaceable><literal>$</literal>.</para>

    <para>All keywords are case-sensitive where they appear as
      anchors in files: you must use the correct capitalization
      for the keyword to be expanded.  You should consider the
      value of the <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property to be
      case-sensitive, too&#x2014;certain keyword names will be recognized
      regardless of case, but this behavior is deprecated.</para>

    <para>Subversion defines the list of keywords available for
      substitution.  That list contains the following five keywords, 
      some of which have aliases that you can also use:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Date</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the last time the file was
            known to have been changed in the repository, and is of
            the form <literal>$Date: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat,
            22 Jul 2006) $</literal>.  It may also be specified as
            <literal>LastChangedDate</literal>.  Unlike the
            <literal>Id</literal> keyword, which uses UTC, the
            <literal>Date</literal> keyword displays dates using the
            local time zone.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Revision</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the last known revision in
            which this file changed in the repository, and looks
            something like <literal>$Revision: 144 $</literal>.  
            It may also be specified as
            <literal>LastChangedRevision</literal> or
            <literal>Rev</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Author</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the last known user to
            change this file in the repository, and looks
            something like <literal>$Author: harry $</literal>.  
            It may also be specified as 
            <literal>LastChangedBy</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>HeadURL</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword describes the full URL to the latest
            version of the file in the repository, and looks
            something like <literal>$HeadURL:
            http://svn.collab.net/repos/trunk/README $</literal>.
            It may be abbreviated as
            <literal>URL</literal>.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>Id</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>This keyword is a compressed combination of the other
            keywords.  Its substitution looks something like
            <literal>$Id: calc.c 148 2006-07-28 21:30:43Z sally
            $</literal>, and is interpreted to mean that the file
            <filename>calc.c</filename> was last changed in revision
            148 on the evening of July 28, 2006 by the user
            <literal>sally</literal>.  The date displayed by this
            keyword is in UTC, unlike that of the
            <literal>Date</literal> keyword (which uses the local time
            zone).</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>Several of the preceding descriptions use the phrase
      <quote>last known</quote> or similar wording.  Keep in mind that
      keyword expansion is a client-side operation, and your client
      <quote>knows</quote> only about changes that have occurred in
      the repository when you update your working copy to include
      those changes.  If you never update your working copy, your
      keywords will never expand to different values even if those
      versioned files are being changed regularly in the
      repository.</para>

    <para>Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does
      nothing special.  Subversion will never attempt to perform
      textual substitutions on your file contents unless
      explicitly asked to do so.  After all, you might be writing
      a document
      <footnote>
        <para>&#x2026; or maybe even a section of a book &#x2026;</para>
      </footnote> 
      about how to use keywords, and you don't want Subversion to
      substitute your beautiful examples of unsubstituted keyword
      anchors!</para>

    <para>To tell Subversion whether to substitute keywords
      on a particular file, we again turn to the property-related
      subcommands.  The <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property,
      when set on a versioned file, controls which keywords will
      be substituted on that file.  The value is a space-delimited
      list of keyword names or aliases.</para>

    <para>For example, say you have a versioned file named
      <filename>weather.txt</filename> that looks like
      this:</para>

    <programlisting>
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate$
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</programlisting>
        
    <para>With no <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property set on
      that file, Subversion will do nothing special.  Now, let's
      enable substitution of the
      <literal>LastChangedDate</literal> keyword.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author" weather.txt
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$
</screen>        
    
    <para>Now you have made a local property modification on the
      <filename>weather.txt</filename> file.  You will see no
      changes to the file's contents (unless you made some of your
      own prior to setting the property).  Notice that the file
      contained a keyword anchor for the <literal>Rev</literal>
      keyword, yet we did not include that keyword in the property
      value we set.  Subversion will happily ignore requests to
      substitute keywords that are not present in the file and
      will not substitute keywords that are not present in the
      <literal>svn:keywords</literal> property value.</para>

    <para>Immediately after you commit this property change,
      Subversion will update your working file with the new
      substitute text.  Instead of seeing your keyword anchor
      <literal>$LastChangedDate$</literal>, you'll see its
      substituted result.  That result also contains the name of
      the keyword and continues to be delimited by the dollar sign
      (<literal>$</literal>) characters.  And as we predicted, the
      <literal>Rev</literal> keyword was not substituted because
      we didn't ask for it to be.</para>

    <para>Note also that we set the <literal>svn:keywords</literal>
      property to <literal>Date Author</literal>, yet the keyword
      anchor used the alias <literal>$LastChangedDate$</literal>
      and still expanded correctly:</para>

    <screen>
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</screen>
        
    <para>If someone else now commits a change to
      <filename>weather.txt</filename>, your copy of that file
      will continue to display the same substituted keyword value
      as before&#x2014;until you update your working copy.  At that
      time, the keywords in your <filename>weather.txt</filename>
      file will be resubstituted with information that
      reflects the most recent known commit to that file.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Where's $GlobalRev$?</title>

      <para>New users are often confused by how the
        <literal>$Rev$</literal> keyword works.  Since the repository
        has a single, globally increasing revision number, many people
        assume that it is this number that is reflected by the
        <literal>$Rev$</literal> keyword's value.  But
        <literal>$Rev$</literal> expands to show the last revision in
        which the file <emphasis>changed</emphasis>, not the last
        revision to which it was updated.  Understanding this clears
        the confusion, but frustration often remains&#x2014;without the
        support of a Subversion keyword to do so, how can you
        automatically get the global revision number into your
        files?</para>

      <para>To do this, you need external processing.  Subversion
        ships with a tool called <command>svnversion</command>, which
        was designed for just this purpose.  It crawls your working
        copy and generates as output the revision(s) it finds.  You
        can use this program, plus some additional tooling, to embed
        that revision information into your files.  For more
        information on <command>svnversion</command>, see <xref linkend="svn.ref.svnversion"/>.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Subversion 1.2 introduced a new variant of the keyword
      syntax, which brought additional, useful&#x2014;though perhaps
      atypical&#x2014;functionality.  You can now tell Subversion
      to maintain a fixed length (in terms of the number of bytes
      consumed) for the substituted keyword.  By using a
      double colon (<literal>::</literal>) after the keyword name,
      followed by a number of space characters, you define that
      fixed width.  When Subversion goes to substitute your
      keyword for the keyword and its value, it will essentially
      replace only those space characters, leaving the overall
      width of the keyword field unchanged.  If the substituted
      value is shorter than the defined field width, there will be
      extra padding characters (spaces) at the end of the
      substituted field; if it is too long, it is truncated with a
      special hash (<literal>#</literal>) character just before
      the final dollar sign terminator.</para>

    <para>For example, say you have a document in which you have
      some section of tabular data reflecting the document's
      Subversion keywords.  Using the original Subversion keyword
      substitution syntax, your file might look something
      like:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev$:     Revision of last commit
$Author$:  Author of last commit
$Date$:    Date of last commit
</screen>
    
    <para>Now, that looks nice and tabular at the start of things.
      But when you then commit that file (with keyword substitution
      enabled, of course), you see:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev: 12 $:     Revision of last commit
$Author: harry $:  Author of last commit
$Date: 2006-03-15 02:33:03 -0500 (Wed, 15 Mar 2006) $:    Date of last commit
</screen>
    
    <para>The result is not so beautiful.  And you might be
      tempted to then adjust the file after the substitution so
      that it again looks tabular.  But that holds only as long as
      the keyword values are the same width.  If the last
      committed revision rolls into a new place value (say, from
      99 to 100), or if another person with a longer username
      commits the file, stuff gets all crooked again.  However, if
      you are using Subversion 1.2 or later, you can use the new
      fixed-length keyword syntax and define some field widths that
      seem sane, so your file might look like this:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev::               $:  Revision of last commit
$Author::            $:  Author of last commit
$Date::              $:  Date of last commit
</screen>
    
    <para>You commit this change to your file.  This time,
      Subversion notices the new fixed-length keyword syntax and
      maintains the width of the fields as defined by the padding
      you placed between the double colon and the trailing dollar
      sign.  After substitution, the width of the fields is
      completely unchanged&#x2014;the short values for
      <literal>Rev</literal> and <literal>Author</literal> are
      padded with spaces, and the long <literal>Date</literal>
      field is truncated by a hash character:</para>

    <screen>
$Rev:: 13            $:  Revision of last commit
$Author:: harry      $:  Author of last commit
$Date:: 2006-03-15 0#$:  Date of last commit
</screen>
       
    <para>The use of fixed-length keywords is especially handy
      when performing substitutions into complex file formats that
      themselves use fixed-length fields for data, or for which
      the stored size of a given data field is overbearingly
      difficult to modify from outside the format's native
      application (such as for Microsoft Office documents).</para>

    <warning>
      <para>Be aware that because the width of a keyword field is
        measured in bytes, the potential for corruption of
        multibyte values exists.  For example, a username that
        contains some multibyte UTF-8 characters might suffer
        truncation in the middle of the string of bytes that make
        up one of those characters.  The result will be a mere
        truncation when viewed at the byte level, but will likely
        appear as a string with an incorrect or garbled final
        character when viewed as UTF-8 text.  It is conceivable
        that certain applications, when asked to load the file,
        would notice the broken UTF-8 text and deem the entire
        file corrupt, refusing to operate on the file
        altogether.  So, when limiting keywords to a fixed size,
        choose a size that allows for this type of byte-wise
        expansion.</para>

    <title>Sparse Directories</title>

    <para>By default, most Subversion operations on directories act in
      a recursive manner.  For example, <command>svn
      checkout</command> creates a working copy with every file and
      directory in the specified area of the repository, descending
      recursively through the repository tree until the entire
      structure is copied to your local disk.  Subversion 1.5
      introduces a feature called <firstterm>sparse
      directories</firstterm> (or <firstterm>shallow
      checkouts</firstterm>) that allows you to easily check out a
      working copy&#x2014;or a portion of a working copy&#x2014;more
      shallowly than full recursion, with the freedom to bring in
      previously ignored files and subdirectories at a later
      time.</para>

    <para>For example, say we have a repository with a tree of files
      and directories with names of the members of a human family with
      pets.  (It's an odd example, to be sure, but bear with us.)  A
      regular <command>svn checkout</command> operation will give us a
      working copy of the whole tree:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom
A    mom/son
A    mom/son/grandson
A    mom/daughter
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny1.txt
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter1/bunny2.txt
A    mom/daughter/granddaughter2
A    mom/daughter/fishie.txt
A    mom/kitty1.txt
A    mom/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$
</screen>

    <para>Now, let's check out the same tree again, but this time
      we'll ask Subversion to give us only the topmost directory
      with none of its children at all:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-empty --depth empty
Checked out revision 1
$
</screen>
 
    <para>Notice that we added to our original <command>svn
      checkout</command> command line a new <option>--depth</option>
      option.  This option is present on many of Subversion's
      subcommands and is similar to the
      <option>--non-recursive</option> (<option>-N</option>) and
      <option>--recursive</option> (<option>-R</option>) options.  In
      fact, it combines, improves upon, supercedes, and ultimately
      obsoletes these two older options.  For starters, it expands the
      supported degrees of depth specification available to users,
      adding some previously unsupported (or inconsistently supported)
      depths.  Here are the depth values that you can request for a
      given Subversion operation:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>--depth empty</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Include only the immediate target of the operation,
            not any of its file or directory children.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>--depth files</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file children.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>--depth immediates</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file or directory children.  The directory
            children will themselves be empty.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>--depth infinity</literal></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Include the immediate target, its file and directory
            children, its children's children, and so on to full
            recursion.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Of course, merely combining two existing options into one
      hardly constitutes a new feature worthy of a whole section in
      our book.  Fortunately, there is more to this story.  This idea
      of depth extends not just to the operations you perform with
      your Subversion client, but also as a description of a working
      copy citizen's <firstterm>ambient depth</firstterm>, which is
      the depth persistently recorded by the working copy for that
      item.  Its key strength is this very persistence&#x2014;the fact
      that it is <firstterm>sticky</firstterm>.  The working copy
      remembers the depth you've selected for each item in it until
      you later change that depth selection; by default, Subversion
      commands operate on the working copy citizens present,
      regardless of their selected depth settings.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>You can check the recorded ambient depth of a working copy
        using the <command>svn info</command> command.  If the ambient
        depth is anything other than infinite recursion, <command>svn
        info</command> will display a line describing that depth
        value:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn info mom-immediates | grep '^Depth:'
Depth: immediates
$
</screen>
    </tip>

    <para>Our previous examples demonstrated checkouts of infinite
      depth (the default for <command>svn checkout</command>) and
      empty depth.  Let's look now at examples of the other depth
      values:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-files --depth files
A    mom-files/kitty1.txt
A    mom-files/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-immediates --depth immediates
A    mom-immediates/son
A    mom-immediates/daughter
A    mom-immediates/kitty1.txt
A    mom-immediates/doggie1.txt
Checked out revision 1.
$
</screen>

    <para>As described, each of these depths is something more than
      only the target, but something less than full recursion.</para>

    <para>We've used <command>svn checkout</command> as an example
      here, but you'll find the <option>--depth</option> option
      present on many other Subversion commands, too.  In those other
      commands, depth specification is a way to limit the scope of an
      operation to some depth, much like the way the older
      <option>--non-recursive</option> (<option>-N</option>) and
      <option>--recursive</option> (<option>-R</option>) options
      behave.  This means that when operating on a working copy of
      some depth, while requesting an operation of a shallower depth,
      the operation is limited to that shallower depth.  In fact, we
      can make an even more general statement: given a working copy of
      any arbitrary&#x2014;even mixed&#x2014;ambient depth, and a
      Subversion command with some requested operational depth, the
      command will maintain the ambient depth of the working copy
      members while still limiting the scope of the operation to the
      requested (or default) operational depth.</para>

    <para>In addition to the <option>--depth</option> option, the
      <command>svn update</command> and <command>svn switch</command>
      subcommands also accept a second depth-related option:
      <option>--set-depth</option>.  It is with this option that you
      can change the sticky depth of a working copy item.  Watch what
      happens as we take our empty-depth checkout and gradually
      telescope it deeper using <userinput>svn update
      --set-depth <replaceable>NEW-DEPTH</replaceable> <replaceable>TARGET</replaceable></userinput>:</para>

    <screen>

</screen>

    <para>As we gradually increased our depth selection, the
      repository gave us more pieces of our tree.</para>

    <para>In our example, we operated only on the root of our working
      copy, changing its ambient depth value.  But we can
      independently change the ambient depth value of
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> subdirectory inside the working copy,
      too.  Careful use of this ability allows us to flesh out only
      certain portions of the working copy tree, leaving other
      portions absent altogether (hence the <quote>sparse</quote> bit
      of the feature's name).  Here's an example of how we might build
      out a portion of one branch of our family's tree, enable full
      recursion on another branch, and keep still other pieces pruned
      (absent from disk).</para>

    <para>Fortunately, having a complex collection of ambient depths
      in a single working copy doesn't complicate the way you interact
      with that working copy.  You can still make, revert, display,
      and commit local modifications in your working copy without
      providing any new options (including <option>--depth</option> and
      <option>--set-depth</option>) to the relevant subcommands.  Even
      <command>svn update</command> works as it does elsewhere when no
      specific depth is provided&#x2014;it updates the working copy
      targets that are present while honoring their sticky
      depths.</para>

    <para>You might at this point be wondering, <quote>So what?  When
      would I use this?</quote>  One scenario where this feature
      finds utility is tied to a particular repository layout,
      specifically where you have many related or codependent
      projects or software modules living as siblings in a single
      repository location (<filename>trunk/project1</filename>,
      <filename>trunk/project2</filename>,
      <filename>trunk/project3</filename>, etc.).  In such
      scenarios, it might be the case that you personally care 
      about only a handful of those projects&#x2014;maybe some primary
      project and a few other modules on which it depends.  You can
      check out individual working copies of all of these things, but
      those working copies are disjoint and, as a result, it can be
      cumbersome to perform operations across several or all of them
      at the same time.  The alternative is to use the sparse
      directories feature, building out a single working copy that
      contains only the modules you care about.  You'd start with an
      empty-depth checkout of the common parent directory of the
      projects, and then update with infinite depth only the items you
      wish to have, like we demonstrated in the previous example.
      Think of it like an opt-in system for working copy
      citizens.</para>

    <para>Subversion 1.5's implementation of shallow checkouts is
      good but does not support a couple of interesting behaviors.
      First, you cannot de-telescope a working copy item.  Running
      <userinput>svn update --set-depth empty</userinput> in an
      infinite-depth working copy will not have the effect of
      discarding everything but the topmost directory&#x2014;it will
      simply error out.  Second, there is no depth value to indicate
      that you wish an item to be explicitly excluded.  You have to do
      implicit exclusion of an item by including everything
      else.</para>

    <title>Locking</title>

    <para>Subversion's copy-modify-merge version control model lives
      and dies on its data merging algorithms&#x2014;specifically on
      how well those algorithms perform when trying to resolve
      conflicts caused by multiple users modifying the same file
      concurrently.  Subversion itself provides only one such
      algorithm:  a three-way differencing algorithm that is smart
      enough to handle data at a granularity of a single line of text.
      Subversion also allows you to supplement its content merge
      processing with external differencing utilities (as described in
      <xref linkend="svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff3"/>), some
      of which may do an even better job, perhaps providing
      granularity of a word or a single character of text.  But common
      among those algorithms is that they generally work only on text
      files.  The landscape starts to look pretty grim when you start
      talking about content merges of nontextual file formats.  And
      when you can't find a tool that can handle that type of merging,
      you begin to run into problems with the copy-modify-merge
      model.</para>

   <para>Let's look at a real-life example of where this model runs
      aground.  Harry and Sally are both graphic designers working on
      the same project, a bit of marketing collateral for an
      automobile mechanic.  Central to the design of a particular
      poster is an image of a car in need of some bodywork, stored in
      a file using the PNG image format.  The poster's layout is
      almost finished, and both Harry and Sally are pleased with the
      particular photo they chose for their damaged car&#x2014;a baby
      blue 1967 Ford Mustang with an unfortunate bit of crumpling on
      the left front fender.</para>

    <para>Now, as is common in graphic design work, there's a change
      in plans, which causes the car's color to be a concern.  So Sally
      updates her working copy to <literal>HEAD</literal>, fires up
      her photo-editing software, and sets about tweaking the image so
      that the car is now cherry red.  Meanwhile, Harry, feeling
      particularly inspired that day, decides that the image would
      have greater impact if the car also appears to have suffered
      greater impact.  He, too, updates to <literal>HEAD</literal>,
      and then draws some cracks on the vehicle's windshield.  He
      manages to finish his work before Sally finishes hers, and after
      admiring the fruits of his undeniable talent, he commits the
      modified image.  Shortly thereafter, Sally is finished with the
      car's new finish and tries to commit her changes.  But, as
      expected, Subversion fails the commit, informing Sally that
      her version of the image is now out of date.</para>

    <para>Here's where the difficulty sets in.  If Harry and Sally
      were making changes to a text file, Sally would simply update
      her working copy, receiving Harry's changes in the process.  In
      the worst possible case, they would have modified the same
      region of the file, and Sally would have to work out by hand the
      proper resolution to the conflict.  But these aren't text
      files&#x2014;they are binary images.  And while it's a simple
      matter to describe what one would expect the results of this
      content merge to be, there is precious little chance that any
      software exists that is smart enough to examine the common
      baseline image that each of these graphic artists worked
      against, the changes that Harry made, and the changes that Sally
      made, and then spit out an image of a busted-up red Mustang with
      a cracked windshield!</para>

    <para>Of course, things would have gone more smoothly if Harry and
      Sally had serialized their modifications to the image&#x2014;if, say,
      Harry had waited to draw his windshield cracks on Sally's
      now-red car, or if Sally had tweaked the color of a car whose
      windshield was already cracked.  As is discussed in <xref linkend="svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge"/>, most of these
      types of problems go away entirely where perfect communication
      between Harry and Sally exists.
      <footnote>
        <para>Communication wouldn't have been such bad medicine for
          Harry and Sally's Hollywood namesakes, either, for that
          matter.</para>
      </footnote>
      But as one's version control system is, in fact, one form of
      communication, it follows that having that software facilitate
      the serialization of nonparallelizable editing efforts is no
      bad thing.  This is where Subversion's implementation of the
      lock-modify-unlock model steps into the spotlight.  This is
      where we talk about Subversion's <firstterm>locking</firstterm>
      feature, which is similar to the <quote>reserved
      checkouts</quote> mechanisms of other version control
      systems.</para>

    <para>Subversion's locking feature exists ultimately to minimize
      wasted time and effort.  By allowing a user to programmatically
      claim the exclusive right to change a file in the repository,
      that user can be reasonably confident that any energy he invests
      on unmergeable changes won't be wasted&#x2014;his commit of those
      changes will succeed.  Also, because Subversion communicates to
      other users that serialization is in effect for a particular
      versioned object, those users can reasonably expect that the
      object is about to be changed by someone else.  They, too, can
      then avoid wasting their time and energy on unmergeable changes
      that won't be committable due to eventual
      out-of-dateness.</para>

    <para>When referring to Subversion's locking feature, one is
      actually talking about a fairly diverse collection of behaviors,
      which include the ability to lock a versioned file
      <footnote>
        <para>Subversion does not currently allow locks on directories.</para>
      </footnote>
      (claiming the exclusive right to modify the file), to unlock
      that file (yielding that exclusive right to modify), to see
      reports about which files are locked and by whom, to annotate
      files for which locking before editing is strongly advised, and
      so on.  In this section, we'll cover all of these facets of the
      larger locking feature.</para>

    <sidebar id="svn.advanced.locking.meanings">
      <title>The Three Meanings of <quote>Lock</quote></title>

      <para>In this section, and almost everywhere in this book, the
        words <quote>lock</quote> and <quote>locking</quote> describe
        a mechanism for mutual exclusion between users to avoid
        clashing commits.  Unfortunately, there are two other sorts
        of <quote>lock</quote> with which Subversion, and therefore
        this book, sometimes needs to be concerned.</para>

      <para>The second is <firstterm>working copy locks</firstterm>,
        used internally by Subversion to prevent clashes between
        multiple Subversion clients operating on the same working
        copy.  This is the sort of lock indicated by an
        <computeroutput>L</computeroutput> in the third column of
        <command>svn status</command> output, and removed by the
        <command>svn cleanup</command> command, as described in <xref linkend="svn.tour.cleanup"/>.</para>

      <para>Third, there are <firstterm>database locks</firstterm>,
        used internally by the Berkeley DB backend to prevent clashes
        between multiple programs trying to access the database.  This
        is the sort of lock whose unwanted persistence after an error
        can cause a repository to be <quote>wedged,</quote> as
        described in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.recovery"/>.</para>

      <para>You can generally forget about these other kinds of locks
        until something goes wrong that requires you to care about
        them.  In this book, <quote>lock</quote> means the first sort
        unless the contrary is either clear from context or explicitly
        stated.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.locking.creation">
      <title>Creating Locks</title>
      
      <para>In the Subversion repository, a
        <firstterm>lock</firstterm> is a piece of metadata that
        grants exclusive access to one user to change a file.  This
        user is said to be the <firstterm>lock owner</firstterm>.
        Each lock also has a unique identifier, typically a long
        string of characters, known as the <firstterm>lock
        token</firstterm>.  The repository manages locks, ultimately
        handling their creation, enforcement, and removal.  If any
        commit transaction attempts to modify or delete a locked file
        (or delete one of the parent directories of the file), the
        repository will demand two pieces of information&#x2014;that
        the client performing the commit be authenticated as the lock
        owner, and that the lock token has been provided as part of
        the commit process as a form of proof that the client knows which
        lock it is using.</para>
      
      <para>To demonstrate lock creation, let's refer back to our
        example of multiple graphic designers working on the same
        binary image files.  Harry has decided to change a JPEG image.
        To prevent other people from committing changes to the file
        while he is modifying it (as well as alerting them that he is
        about to change it), he locks the file in the repository using
        the <command>svn lock</command> command.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn lock banana.jpg -m "Editing file for tomorrow's release."
'banana.jpg' locked by user 'harry'.
$
</screen>

      <para>The preceding example demonstrates a number of new things.
        First, notice that Harry passed the
        <option>--message</option> (<option>-m</option>) option to
        <command>svn lock</command>.  Similar to <command>svn
        commit</command>, the <command>svn lock</command> command can
        take comments&#x2014;via either <option>--message</option>
        (<option>-m</option>) or <option>--file</option>
        (<option>-F</option>)&#x2014;to describe the reason for locking the
        file.  Unlike <command>svn commit</command>, however,
        <command>svn lock</command> will not demand a message by
        launching your preferred text editor.  Lock comments are
        optional, but still recommended to aid communication.</para>

      <para>Second, the lock attempt succeeded.  This means that the
        file wasn't already locked, and that Harry had the latest
        version of the file.  If Harry's working copy of the file had
        been out of date, the repository would have rejected the
        request, forcing Harry to <command>svn update</command> and
        reattempt the locking command.  The locking command would also
        have failed if the file had already been locked by someone
        else.</para>

      <para>As you can see, the <command>svn lock</command> command
        prints confirmation of the successful lock.  At this point,
        the fact that the file is locked becomes apparent in the
        output of the <command>svn status</command> and <command>svn
        info</command> reporting subcommands.</para>

      <para>The fact that the <command>svn info</command> command,
        which does not contact the repository when run against working
        copy paths, can display the lock token reveals an important
        piece of information about those tokens:  they are cached in
        the working copy.  The presence of the lock token is critical.
        It gives the working copy authorization to make use of the
        lock later on.  Also, the <command>svn status</command>
        command shows a <literal>K</literal> next to the file (short
        for locKed), indicating that the lock token is present.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Regarding Lock Tokens</title>

        <para>A lock token isn't an authentication token, so much as
          an <emphasis>authorization</emphasis> token.  The token
          isn't a protected secret.  In fact, a lock's unique token is
          discoverable by anyone who runs <userinput>svn info
          <replaceable>URL</replaceable></userinput>.  A lock token is special only when it lives
          inside a working copy.  It's proof that the lock was created
          in that particular working copy, and not somewhere else by
          some other client.  Merely authenticating as the lock owner
          isn't enough to prevent accidents.</para>

        <para>For example, suppose you lock a file using a computer at
          your office, but leave work for the day before you finish
          your changes to that file.  It should not be possible to
          accidentally commit changes to that same file from your home
          computer later that evening simply because you've
          authenticated as the lock's owner.  In other words, the lock
          token prevents one piece of Subversion-related software from
          undermining the work of another.  (In our example, if you
          really need to change the file from an alternative working
          copy, you would need to <firstterm>break</firstterm> the lock and relock the
          file.)</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Now that Harry has locked <filename>banana.jpg</filename>,
        Sally is unable to change or delete that file:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn delete banana.jpg
D         banana.jpg
$ svn commit -m "Delete useless file."
Deleting       banana.jpg
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Server sent unexpected return value (423 Locked) in response to DELETE\
 request for '/repos/project/!svn/wrk/64bad3a9-96f9-0310-818a-df4224ddc35d/\
banana.jpg'
$
</screen>

      <para>But Harry, after touching up the banana's shade of yellow,
        is able to commit his changes to the file.  That's because he
        authenticates as the lock owner and also because his working
        copy holds the correct lock token:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
M    K banana.jpg
$ svn commit -m "Make banana more yellow"
Sending        banana.jpg
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2201.
$ svn status
$
</screen>

      <para>Notice that after the commit is finished, <command>svn
        status</command> shows that the lock token is no longer
        present in the working copy.  This is the standard behavior of
        <command>svn commit</command>&#x2014;it searches the working
        copy (or list of targets, if you provide such a list) for
        local modifications and sends all the lock tokens it
        encounters during this walk to the server as part of the
        commit transaction.  After the commit completes successfully,
        all of the repository locks that were mentioned are
        released&#x2014;<emphasis>even on files that weren't
        committed</emphasis>.  This is meant to discourage users from
        being sloppy about locking or from holding locks for too long.
        If Harry haphazardly locks 30 files in a directory named
        <filename>images</filename> because he's unsure of which files
        he needs to change, yet changes only four of those files, when he
        runs <userinput>svn commit images</userinput>, the process will
        still release all 30 locks.</para>

      <para>This behavior of automatically releasing locks can be
        overridden with the <option>--no-unlock</option> option to
        <command>svn commit</command>.  This is best used for those
        times when you want to commit changes, but still plan to make
        more changes and thus need to retain existing locks.  You can
        also make this your default behavior by setting the
        <literal>no-unlock</literal> runtime configuration option (see
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>).</para>

      <para>Of course, locking a file doesn't oblige one to commit a
        change to it.  The lock can be released at any time with a
        simple <command>svn unlock</command> command:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn unlock banana.c
'banana.c' unlocked.
</screen>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.locking.discovery">
      <title>Discovering Locks</title>

      <para>When a commit fails due to someone else's locks, it's
        fairly easy to learn about them.  The easiest way is to run
        <userinput>svn status --show-updates</userinput>:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status -u

$
</screen>

      <para>In this example, Sally can see not only that her copy of
        <filename>foo.h</filename> is out of date, but also that one of the
        two modified files she plans to commit is locked in the
        repository.  The <literal>O</literal> symbol stands for
        <quote>Other,</quote> meaning that a lock exists on the file
        and was created by somebody else.  If she were to attempt a
        commit, the lock on <filename>raisin.jpg</filename> would
        prevent it.  Sally is left wondering who made the lock, when,
        and why.  Once again, <command>svn info</command> has the
        answers:</para>

      <para>Just as you can use <command>svn info</command> to examine
        objects in the working copy, you can also use it to examine
        objects in the repository.  If the main argument to
        <command>svn info</command> is a working copy path, then all
        of the working copy's cached information is displayed; any
        mention of a lock means that the working copy is holding a
        lock token (if a file is locked by another user or in another
        working copy, <command>svn info</command> on a working copy
        path will show no lock information at all).  If the main
        argument to <command>svn info</command> is a URL, the
        information reflects the latest version of an object in the
        repository, and any mention of a lock describes the current
        lock on the object.</para>

      <para>So in this particular example, Sally can see that Harry
        locked the file on February 16 to <quote>make a quick
        tweak.</quote>  It being June, she suspects that he probably
        forgot all about the lock.  She might phone Harry to complain
        and ask him to release the lock.  If he's unavailable, she
        might try to forcibly break the lock herself or ask an
        administrator to do so.</para>

        to this as <firstterm>breaking the lock</firstterm>.</para>

      <para>From the administrator's chair, it's simple to break
        locks.  The <command>svnlook</command>
        and <command>svnadmin</command> programs have the ability to

      <para>The more interesting option is to allow users to break
        each other's locks over the network.  To do this, Sally simply
        needs to pass the <option>--force</option> to the <command>svn
        unlock</command> command:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status -u
M              23   bar.c
M    O         32   raisin.jpg

$ svn unlock raisin.jpg
svn: 'raisin.jpg' is not locked in this working copy
$ svn info raisin.jpg | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
$ svn unlock http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
svn: Unlock request failed: 403 Forbidden (http://svn.example.com)
$ svn unlock --force http://svn.example.com/repos/project/raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' unlocked.
$
</screen>

      <para>Now, Sally's initial attempt to unlock failed because she
        ran <command>svn unlock</command> directly on her working copy
        of the file, and no lock token was present.  To remove the
        lock directly from the repository, she needs to pass a URL
        to <command>svn unlock</command>.  Her first attempt to unlock
        the URL fails, because she can't authenticate as the lock
        owner (nor does she have the lock token).  But when she
        passes <option>--force</option>, the authentication and
        authorization requirements are ignored, and the remote lock is
        broken.</para>
        
      <para>Simply breaking a lock may not be enough.  In
        the running example, Sally may not only want to break Harry's
        long-forgotten lock, but relock the file for her own use.
        She can accomplish this by using <command>svn unlock</command>
        with <option>--force</option> and then <command>svn lock</command>
        back-to-back, but there's a small chance that somebody else
        might lock the file between the two commands.  The simpler thing
        to do is to <firstterm>steal</firstterm> the lock, which involves
        breaking and relocking the file all in one atomic step.  To
        do this, Sally passes the <option>--force</option> option
        to <command>svn lock</command>:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn lock raisin.jpg
svn: Lock request failed: 423 Locked (http://svn.example.com)
$ svn lock --force raisin.jpg
'raisin.jpg' locked by user 'sally'.
$
</screen>

      <para>In any case, whether the lock is broken or stolen, Harry
        may be in for a surprise.  Harry's working copy still contains
        the original lock token, but that lock no longer exists.  The
        lock token is said to be <firstterm>defunct</firstterm>.  The
        lock represented by the lock token has either been broken (no
        longer in the repository) or stolen (replaced with a
        different lock).  Either way, Harry can see this by asking
        <command>svn status</command> to contact the
        repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
     K raisin.jpg
$ svn status -u
     B         32   raisin.jpg
$ svn update

$ svn status
$
</screen>

      <para>If the repository lock was broken, then <userinput>svn
        status --show-updates</userinput> displays a
        <literal>B</literal> (Broken) symbol next to the file.  If a
        new lock exists in place of the old one, then a
        <literal>T</literal> (sTolen) symbol is shown.  Finally,
        <command>svn update</command> notices any defunct lock tokens
        and removes them from the working copy.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Locking Policies</title>
        
        <para>Different systems have different notions of how strict a
          lock should be.  Some folks argue that locks must be
          strictly enforced at all costs, releasable only by the
          original creator or administrator.  They argue that if
          anyone can break a lock, chaos runs rampant and the
          whole point of locking is defeated.  The other side argues
          that locks are first and foremost a communication tool.  If
          users are constantly breaking each other's locks, it
          represents a cultural failure within the team and the
          problem falls outside the scope of software enforcement.</para>

        <para>Subversion defaults to the <quote>softer</quote>
          approach, but still allows administrators to create stricter
          enforcement policies through the use of hook scripts.  In
          particular, the <filename>pre-lock</filename> and
          <filename>pre-unlock</filename> hooks allow administrators
          to decide when lock creation and lock releases are allowed
          to happen.  Depending on whether a lock already exists,
          these two hooks can decide whether to allow a certain user
          to break or steal a lock.  The
          <filename>post-lock</filename> and
          <filename>post-unlock</filename> hooks are also available,
          and can be used to send email after locking actions.  To
          learn more about repository hooks, see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.hooks"/>.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.locking.lock-communication">
      <title>Lock Communication</title>

      <para>We've seen how <command>svn lock</command>
        and <command>svn unlock</command> can be used to create,
        release, break, and steal locks.  This satisfies the goal of
        serializing commit access to a file.  But what about the
        larger problem of preventing wasted time?</para>

      <para>For example, suppose Harry locks an image file and then
        begins editing it.  Meanwhile, miles away, Sally wants to do
        the same thing.  She doesn't think to run <userinput>svn status
        --show-updates</userinput>, so she has no idea that Harry has
        already locked the file.  She spends hours editing the file,
        and when she tries to commit her change, she discovers that
        either the file is locked or that she's out of date.
        Regardless, her changes aren't mergeable with Harry's.  One of
        these two people has to throw away his or her work, and a lot of
        time has been wasted.</para>
      
      <para>Subversion's solution to this problem is to provide a
        mechanism to remind users that a file ought to be locked
        <emphasis>before</emphasis> the editing begins.  The mechanism
        is a special property:  <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal>.  If
        that property is attached to a file (regardless of its value,
        which is irrelevant), Subversion will try to use
        filesystem-level permissions to make the file read-only&#x2014;unless,
        of course, the user has explicitly locked the file.
        When a lock token is present (as a result of using
        <command>svn lock</command>), the file becomes read/write.
        When the lock is released, the file becomes read-only
        again.</para>

      <para>The theory, then, is that if the image file has this
        property attached, Sally would immediately notice
        something is strange when she opens the file for editing:
        many applications alert users immediately when a read-only
        file is opened for editing, and nearly all would
        prevent her from saving changes to the file.  This
        reminds her to lock the file before editing, whereby she
        discovers the preexisting lock:</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Users and administrators alike are encouraged to attach
          the <literal>svn:needs-lock</literal> property to any file
          that cannot be contextually merged.  This is the primary
          technique for encouraging good locking habits and preventing
          wasted effort.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Note that this property is a communication tool that
        works independently from the locking system.  In other words,
        any file can be locked, whether or not this property is
        present.  And conversely, the presence of this property
        doesn't make the repository require a lock when
        committing.</para>

      <para>Unfortunately, the system isn't flawless.  It's possible
        that even when a file has the property, the read-only reminder
        won't always work.  Sometimes applications misbehave and
        <quote>hijack</quote> the read-only file, silently allowing
        users to edit and save the file anyway.  There's not much that
        Subversion can do in this situation&#x2014;at the end of the
        day, there's simply no substitution for good interpersonal
        communication.

  <sect1 id="svn.advanced.externals">
    <title>Externals Definitions</title>
    
    <para>Sometimes it is useful to construct a working copy that is
      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different subdirectories to come from different
      locations in a repository or perhaps from different
      repositories altogether.  You could certainly set up such a
      scenario by hand&#x2014;using <command>svn checkout</command> to
      create the sort of nested working copy structure you are trying
      to achieve.  But if this layout is important for everyone who
      uses your repository, every other user will need to perform the
      same checkout operations that you did.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, Subversion provides support for
      <firstterm>externals definitions</firstterm>.  An externals
      definition is a mapping of a local directory to the
      URL&#x2014;and ideally a particular revision&#x2014;of a versioned
      directory.  In Subversion, you declare externals definitions in
      groups using the <literal>svn:externals</literal> property.  You
      can create or modify this property using <command>svn
      propset</command> or <command>svn propedit</command> (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.manip"/>).  It can be set on any
      versioned directory, and its value describes both the external
      repository location and the client-side directory to which that
      location should be checked out.</para>

    <para>The convenience of the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property is that once it is set on a versioned directory,
      everyone who checks out a working copy with that directory also
      gets the benefit of the externals definition.  In other words,
      once one person has made the effort to define the nested working
      copy structure, no one else has to bother&#x2014;Subversion will,
      after checking out the original working copy, automatically also
      check out the external working copies.</para>

    <warning>
      <para>The relative target subdirectories of externals
        definitions <emphasis>must not</emphasis> already exist on
        your or other users' systems&#x2014;Subversion will create them
        when it checks out the external working copy.</para>
    </warning>

    <para>You also get in the externals definition design all the
      regular benefits of Subversion properties.  The definitions are
      versioned.  If you need to change an externals definition, you
      can do so using the regular property modification subcommands.
      When you commit a change to the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
      property, Subversion will synchronize the checked-out items
      against the changed externals definition when you next run
      <userinput>svn update</userinput>.  The same thing will happen when
      others update their working copies and receive your changes to
      the externals definition.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>Because the <literal>svn:externals</literal> property has
        a multiline value, we strongly recommend that you use
        <command>svn propedit</command> instead of <command>svn
        propset</command>.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>Subversion releases prior to 1.5 honor an externals
      definition format that is a multiline table of subdirectories
      (relative to the versioned directory on which the property is
      set), optional revision flags, and fully qualified, absolute
      Subversion repository URLs.  An example of this might look as
      follows:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
third-party/sounds             http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds
third-party/skins -r148        http://svn.example.com/skinproj
third-party/skins/toolkit -r21 http://svn.example.com/skin-maker
</screen>

    <para>When someone checks out a working copy of the
      <filename>calc</filename> directory referred to in the previous
      example, Subversion also continues to check out the items found
      in its externals definition.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc

    <para>As of Subversion 1.5, though, a new format of the
      <literal>svn:externals</literal> property is supported.
      Externals definitions are still multiline, but the order and
      format of the various pieces of information have changed.  The
      new syntax more closely mimics the order of arguments you might
      pass to <command>svn checkout</command>: the optional revision
      flags come first, then the external Subversion repository URL,
      and finally the relative local subdirectory.  Notice, though,
      that this time we didn't say <quote>fully qualified, absolute
      Subversion repository URLs.</quote> That's because the new
      format supports relative URLs and URLs that carry peg revisions.
      The previous example of an externals definition might, in
      Subversion 1.5, look like the following:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
      http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
-r148 http://svn.example.com/skinproj third-party/skins
-r21  http://svn.example.com/skin-maker third-party/skins/toolkit
</screen>

    <para>Or, making use of the peg revision syntax (which we describe
      in detail in <xref linkend="svn.advanced.pegrevs"/>), it might
      appear as:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
http://svn.example.com/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
http://svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit
</screen>

    <tip>
      <para>You should seriously consider using explicit revision
        numbers in all of your externals definitions.  Doing so means
        that you get to decide when to pull down a different snapshot
        of external information, and exactly which snapshot to pull.
        Besides avoiding the surprise of getting changes to
        third-party repositories that you might not have any control
        over, using explicit revision numbers also means that as you
        backdate your working copy to a previous revision, your
        externals definitions will also revert to the way they looked
        in that previous revision, which in turn means that the
        external working copies will be updated to match the way
        <emphasis>they</emphasis> looked back when your repository was
        at that previous revision.  For software projects, this could
        be the difference between a successful and a failed build of
        an older snapshot of your complex codebase.</para> 
    </tip>

    <para>For most repositories, these three ways of formatting the
      externals definitions have the same ultimate effect.  They all
      bring the same benefits.  Unfortunately, they all bring the same
      annoyances, too.  Since the definitions shown use absolute URLs,
      moving or copying a directory to which they are attached will
      not affect what gets checked out as an external (though the
      relative local target subdirectory will, of course, move with the
      renamed directory).  This can be confusing&#x2014;even
      frustrating&#x2014;in certain situations.  For example, say you
      have a top-level directory named
      <filename>my-project</filename>, and you've created an externals
      definition on one of its subdirectories
      (<filename>my-project/some-dir</filename>) that tracks the
      latest revision of another of its subdirectories
      (<filename>my-project/external-dir</filename>).</para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/projects .
A    my-project
A    my-project/some-dir
A    my-project/external-dir
&#x2026;
Fetching external item into 'my-project/some-dir/subdir'

Checked out revision 11.
$ svn propget svn:externals my-project/some-dir
subdir http://svn.example.com/projects/my-project/external-dir

$
</screen>

    <para>Now you use <command>svn move</command> to rename the
      <filename>my-project</filename> directory.  At this point, your
      externals definition will still refer to a path under the
      <filename>my-project</filename> directory, even though that
      directory no longer exists.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn move -q my-project renamed-project
$ svn commit -m "Rename my-project to renamed-project."

Adding         renamed-project

Committed revision 12.
$ svn update

Fetching external item into 'renamed-project/some-dir/subdir'
svn: Target path does not exist
$
</screen>

    <para>Also, absolute URLs can cause problems with repositories
      that are available via multiple URL schemes.  For example, if
      your Subversion server is configured to allow everyone to check
      out the repository over <literal>http://</literal> or
      <literal>https://</literal>, but only allow commits to come in
      via <literal>https://</literal>, you have an interesting problem
      on your hands.  If your externals definitions use the
      <literal>http://</literal> form of the repository URLs, you
      won't be able to commit anything from the working copies created
      by those externals.  On the other hand, if they use the
      <literal>https://</literal> form of the URLs, anyone who might
      be checking out via <literal>http://</literal> because his
      client doesn't support <literal>https://</literal> will be
      unable to fetch the external items.  Be aware, too, that if you
      need to reparent your working copy (using <command>svn switch</command>
      with the <option>--relocate</option> option), externals definitions will
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> also be reparented.</para>

   <para>Subversion 1.5 takes a huge step in relieving these
     frustrations.  As mentioned earlier, the URLs used in the new
     externals definition format can be relative, and Subversion
     provides syntax magic for specifying multiple flavors of URL
     relativity.</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>../</literal></term> 
        <listitem><para>Relative to the URL of the directory on which
          the <literal>svn:externals</literal> property is
          set</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>^/</literal></term> 
        <listitem><para>Relative to the root of the repository in
          which the <literal>svn:externals</literal> property is
          versioned</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>//</literal></term> 
        <listitem><para>Relative to the scheme of the URL of the
          directory on which the <literal>svn:externals</literal>
          property is set</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><literal>/</literal></term>
        <listitem><para>Relative to the root URL of the server on
          which the <literal>svn:externals</literal> property is
          versioned</para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>So, looking a fourth time at our previous externals
      definition example, and making use of the new absolute URL
      syntax in various ways, we might now see:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
^/sounds third-party/sounds
/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
//svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit
</screen>

    <para>The support that exists for externals definitions in
      Subversion remains less than ideal, though.  An externals
      definition can point only to directories, not to files.  Also, the
      local subdirectory part of the definition cannot contain
      <literal>..</literal> parent directory indicators (such as
      <filename>../../skins/myskin</filename>).  Perhaps most
      disappointingly, the working copies created via the externals
      definition support are still disconnected from the primary
      working copy (on whose versioned directories the
      <literal>svn:externals</literal> property was actually set).
      And Subversion still truly operates only on nondisjoint working
      copies.  So, for example, if you want to commit changes that
      you've made in one or more of those external working copies, you
      must run <command>svn commit</command> explicitly on those
      working copies&#x2014;committing on the primary working copy will
      not recurse into any external ones.</para>

    <para>We've already mentioned some of the additional shortcomings
      of the old <literal>svn:externals</literal> format and how the
      new Subversion 1.5 format improves upon it.  But be careful when
      making use of the new format that you don't inadvertently cause
      problems for other folks accessing your repository who are using
      older Subversion clients.  While Subversion 1.5 clients will
      continue to recognize and support the original externals
      definition format, older clients will <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      be able to correctly parse the new format.</para>

    <para>Besides the <command>svn checkout</command>, <command>svn
      update</command>, <command>svn switch</command>, and
      <command>svn export</command> commands which actually manage the
      <firstterm>disjoint</firstterm> (or disconnected) subdirectories
      into which externals are checked out, the <command>svn
      status</command> command also recognizes externals definitions.
      It displays a status code of <literal>X</literal> for the
      disjoint external subdirectories, and then recurses into those
      subdirectories to display the status of the external items
      themselves.  You can pass the
      <option>--ignore-externals</option> option to any of these
      subcommands to disable externals definition processing.</para>

    <title>Peg and Operative Revisions</title>

    <para>We copy, move, rename, and completely replace files and
      directories on our computers all the time.  And your version
      control system shouldn't get in the way of your doing these
      things with your version-controlled files and directories,
      either.  Subversion's file management support is quite
      liberating, affording almost as much flexibility for versioned
      files as you'd expect when manipulating your unversioned ones.
      But that flexibility means that across the lifetime of your
      repository, a given versioned object might have many paths, and
      a given path might represent several entirely different
      versioned objects.  This introduces a certain level of
      complexity to your interactions with those paths and
      objects.</para>

    <para>Subversion is pretty smart about noticing when an object's
      version history includes such <quote>changes of address.</quote>
      For example, if you ask for the revision history log of a
      particular file that was renamed last week, Subversion happily
      provides all those logs&#x2014;the revision in which the rename
      itself happened, plus the logs of relevant revisions both before
      and after that rename.  So, most of the time, you don't even
      have to think about such things.  But occasionally, Subversion
      needs your help to clear up ambiguities.</para>

    <para>The simplest example of this occurs when a directory or file
      is deleted from version control, and then a new directory or
      file is created with the same name and added to version control.
      The thing you deleted and the thing you later added aren't the
      same thing.  They merely happen to have had the same
      path&#x2014;<filename>/trunk/object</filename>, for example.
      What, then, does it mean to ask Subversion about the history of
      <filename>/trunk/object</filename>?  Are you asking about the
      thing currently at that location, or the old thing you deleted
      from that location?  Are you asking about the operations that
      have happened to <emphasis>all</emphasis> the objects that have
      ever lived at that path?  Subversion needs a hint about what you
      really want.</para>

    <para>And thanks to moves, versioned object history can get far
      more twisted than even that.  For example, you might have a
      directory named <filename>concept</filename>, containing some
      nascent software project you've been toying with.  Eventually,
      though, that project matures to the point that the idea seems to
      actually have some wings, so you do the unthinkable and decide
      to give the project a name.
      <footnote>
        <para><quote>You're not supposed to name it.  Once you name it,
          you start getting attached to it.</quote>&#x2014;Mike
          Wazowski</para>
      </footnote>
      Let's say you called your software Frabnaggilywort.  At this
      point, it makes sense to rename the directory to reflect the
      project's new name, so <filename>concept</filename> is renamed
      to <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename>.  Life goes on,
      Frabnaggilywort releases a 1.0 version and is downloaded and
      used daily by hordes of people aiming to improve their
      lives.</para>
    
    <para>It's a nice story, really, but it doesn't end there.
      Entrepreneur that you are, you've already got another think in
      the tank.  So you make a new directory,
      <filename>concept</filename>, and the cycle begins again.  In
      fact, the cycle begins again many times over the years, each
      time starting with that old <filename>concept</filename>
      directory, then sometimes seeing that directory renamed as the
      idea cures, sometimes seeing it deleted when you scrap the idea.
      Or, to get really sick, maybe you rename
      <filename>concept</filename> to something else for a while, but
      later rename the thing back to <filename>concept</filename> for
      some reason.</para>

    <para>In scenarios like these, attempting to instruct
      Subversion to work with these reused paths can be a little like
      instructing a motorist in Chicago's West Suburbs to drive east
      down Roosevelt Road and turn left onto Main Street.  In a mere
      20 minutes, you can cross <quote>Main Street</quote> in
      Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, and Lombard.  And no, they aren't the same
      street.  Our motorist&#x2014;and our Subversion&#x2014;need a
      little more detail to do the right thing.</para>

    <para>In version 1.1, Subversion introduced a way for you to tell
      it exactly which Main Street you meant.  It's called the
      <firstterm>peg revision</firstterm>, and it is provided to
      Subversion for the sole purpose of identifying a unique line of
      history.  Because at most, one versioned object may occupy a path
      at any given time&#x2014;or, more precisely, in any one
      revision&#x2014;the combination of a path and a peg revision is
      all that is needed to refer to a specific line of history.  Peg
      revisions are specified to the Subversion command-line client
      using <firstterm>at syntax</firstterm>, so called because the
      syntax involves appending an <quote>at sign</quote>
      (<literal>@</literal>) and the peg revision to the end of the
      path with which the revision is associated.</para>

    <para>But what of the <option>--revision</option>
      (<option>-r</option>) of which we've spoken so much in this
      book?  That revision (or set of revisions) is called the
      <firstterm>operative revision</firstterm> (or
      <firstterm>operative revision range</firstterm>).  Once a
      particular line of history has been identified using a path and
      peg revision, Subversion performs the requested operation using
      the operative revision(s).  To map this to our Chicagoland
      streets analogy, if we are told to go to 606 N. Main Street in
      Wheaton,
      <footnote>
        <para>606 N. Main Street, Wheaton, Illinois, is the home of
          the Wheaton <emphasis>History</emphasis> Center.  It seemed
          appropriate&#x2026;.</para>
      </footnote>
      we can think of <quote>Main Street</quote> as our path and
      <quote>Wheaton</quote> as our peg revision.  These two pieces of
      information identify a unique path that can be traveled (north or
      south on Main Street), and they keep us from traveling up and
      down the wrong Main Street in search of our destination.  Now we
      throw in <quote>606 N.</quote> as our operative revision of
      sorts, and we know <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> where to
      go.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>The Peg Revision Algorithm</title>
      
      <para>The Subversion command-line client performs the peg revision
        algorithm any time it needs to resolve possible ambiguities in
        the paths and revisions provided to it.  Here's an example of
        such an invocation:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn <replaceable>command</replaceable> -r <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable> item@<replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>
</screen>
      
      <para>If <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable> is older than
        <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>, the algorithm is as
        follows:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Locate <replaceable>item</replaceable> in the revision
            identified by <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>.  There
            can be only one such object.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Trace the object's history backwards (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the revision
            <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Perform the requested action on that ancestor,
            wherever it is located, or whatever its name might
            be or might have been at that time.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>But what if <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable> is
        <emphasis>younger</emphasis> than
        <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>?  Well, that adds some
        complexity to the theoretical problem of locating the path in
        <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>, because the path's
        history could have forked multiple times (thanks to copy
        operations) between <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable> and
        <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>.  And that's not
        all&#x2014;Subversion doesn't store enough information to
        performantly trace an object's history forward, anyway.  So
        the algorithm is a little different:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Locate <replaceable>item</replaceable> in the revision
            identified by <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>.  There
            can be only one such object.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Trace the object's history backward (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the revision
            <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Verify that the object's location (path-wise) in
            <replaceable>PEG-REV</replaceable> is the same as it is in
            <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>.  If that's the
            case, at least the two locations are known to be
            directly related, so perform the requested action on the
            location in <replaceable>OPERATIVE-REV</replaceable>.
            Otherwise, relatedness was not established, so error out
            with a loud complaint that no viable location was found.
            (Someday, we expect that Subversion will be able to handle
            this usage scenario with more flexibility and
            grace.)</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Note that even when you don't explicitly supply a peg
        revision or operative revision, they are still present.  For
        your convenience, the default peg revision is
        <literal>BASE</literal> for working copy items and
        <literal>HEAD</literal> for repository URLs.  And when no
        operative revision is provided, it defaults to being the same
        revision as the peg revision.</para>
        
    </sidebar>

    <para>Say that long ago we created our repository, and in revision 1
      we added our first <filename>concept</filename> directory, plus an
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file in that directory talking about
      the concept.  After several revisions in which real code was
      added and tweaked, we, in revision 20, renamed this directory to
      <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename>.  By revision 27, we had a
      new concept, a new <filename>concept</filename> directory to
      hold it, and a new <filename>IDEA</filename> file to describe
      it.  And then five years and thousands of revisions flew by,
      just like they would in any good romance story.</para>

    <para>Now, years later, we wonder what the
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file looked like back in revision 1.
      But Subversion needs to know whether we are asking about how the
      <emphasis>current</emphasis> file looked back in revision 1, or
      whether we are asking for the contents of whatever file lived at
      <filename>concepts/IDEA</filename> in revision 1.  Certainly
      those questions have different answers, and because of peg
      revisions, you can ask those questions.  To find out how the
      current <filename>IDEA</filename> file looked in that old
      revision, you run:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA 
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</screen>

    <para>Of course, in this example, the current
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file didn't exist yet in revision 1,
      so Subversion gives an error.  The previous command is shorthand
      for a longer notation which explicitly lists a peg revision.
      The expanded notation is:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA@BASE
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</screen>

    <para>And when executed, it has the expected results.</para>

    <para>The perceptive reader is probably wondering at this point whether
      the peg revision syntax causes problems for working copy paths
      or URLs that actually have at signs in them.  After
      all, how does <command>svn</command> know whether
      <literal>news@11</literal> is the name of a directory in my
      tree or just a syntax for <quote>revision 11 of
      <filename>news</filename></quote>?  Thankfully, while
      <command>svn</command> will always assume the latter, there is a
      trivial workaround.  You need only append an at sign to the
      end of the path, such as <literal>news@11@</literal>.
      <command>svn</command> cares only about the last at sign in
      the argument, and it is not considered illegal to omit a literal
      peg revision specifier after that at sign.  This workaround
      even applies to paths that end in an at sign&#x2014;you would
      use <literal>filename@@</literal> to talk about a file named
      <filename>filename@</filename>.</para>

    <para>Let's ask the other question, then&#x2014;in revision 1, what
      were the contents of whatever file occupied the address
      <filename>concepts/IDEA</filename> at the time?  We'll use an
      explicit peg revision to help us out.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat concept/IDEA@1
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software
that can frab a naggily wort.  Frabbing naggily worts is tricky
business, and doing it incorrectly can have serious ramifications, so
we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.
</screen>

    <para>Notice that we didn't provide an operative revision this
      time.  That's because when no operative revision is specified,
      Subversion assumes a default operative revision that's the same
      as the peg revision.</para>

    <para>As you can see, the output from our operation appears to be
      correct.  The text even mentions frabbing naggily worts, so this
      is almost certainly the file that describes the software now
      called Frabnaggilywort.  In fact, we can verify this using the
      combination of an explicit peg revision and explicit operative
      revision.  We know that in <literal>HEAD</literal>, the
      Frabnaggilywort project is located in the
      <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename> directory.  So we specify
      that we want to see how the line of history identified in
      <literal>HEAD</literal> as the path
      <filename>frabnaggilywort/IDEA</filename> looked in revision
      1.</para>

    <screen>
$ svn cat -r 1 frabnaggilywort/IDEA@HEAD

</screen>

    <para>And the peg and operative revisions need not be so trivial,
      either.  For example, say <filename>frabnaggilywort</filename>
      had been deleted from <literal>HEAD</literal>, but we know it
      existed in revision 20, and we want to see the diffs for its
      <filename>IDEA</filename> file between revisions 4 and 10.  We
      can use the peg revision 20 in conjunction with the URL that
      would have held Frabnaggilywort's <filename>IDEA</filename> file
      in revision 20, and then use 4 and 10 as our operative revision
      range.</para>

    <title>Changelists</title>

    <para>It is commonplace for a developer to find himself working at
      any given time on multiple different, distinct changes to a
      particular bit of source code.  This isn't necessarily due to
      poor planning or some form of digital masochism.  A software
      engineer often spots bugs in his peripheral vision while working
      on some nearby chunk of source code.  Or perhaps he's halfway
      through some large change when he realizes the solution he's
      working on is best committed as several smaller logical units.
      Often, these logical units aren't nicely contained in some
      module, safely separated from other changes.  The units might
      overlap, modifying different files in the same module, or even
      modifying different lines in the same file.</para>

    <para>Developers can employ various work methodologies
      to keep these logical changes organized.  Some use
      separate working copies of the same repository to hold each
      individual change in progress.  Others might choose to create
      short-lived feature branches in the repository and use a single
      working copy that is constantly switched to point to one such
      branch or another.  Still others use <command>diff</command> and
      <command>patch</command> tools to back up and restore uncommitted
      changes to and from patch files associated with each change.
      Each of these methods has its pros and cons, and to a large
      degree, the details of the changes being made heavily influence
      the methodology used to distinguish them.</para>

    <para>Subversion 1.5 brings a new
      <firstterm>changelists</firstterm> feature that adds yet
      another method to the mix.  Changelists are basically arbitrary
      labels (currently at most one per file) applied to working copy files for the express purpose of
      associating multiple files together.  Users of many of Google's
      software offerings are familiar with this concept already.  For
      example, <ulink url="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</ulink>
      doesn't provide the traditional folders-based email organization
      mechanism.  In Gmail, you apply arbitrary labels to emails, and
      multiple emails can be said to be part of the same group if they
      happen to share a particular label.  Viewing only a group of
      similarly labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface
      trick.  Many other Web 2.0 sites have similar
      mechanisms&#x2014;consider the <quote>tags</quote> used by sites
      such as <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</ulink> and
      <ulink url="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</ulink>,
      <quote>categories</quote> applied to blog posts, and so on.
      Folks understand today that organization of data is critical,
      but that how that data is organized needs to be a flexible
      concept.  The old files-and-folders paradigm is too rigid for
      some applications.</para>

    <para>Subversion's changelist support allows you to create
      changelists by applying labels to files you want to be
      associated with that changelist, remove those labels, and limit
      the scope of the files on which its subcommands operate to only
      those bearing a particular label.  In this section, we'll look
      in detail at how to do these things.</para>

      <title>Creating and Modifying Changelists</title>

      <para>You can create, modify, and delete changelists using the
        <command>svn changelist</command> command.  More accurately,
        you use this command to set or unset the changelist
        association of a particular working copy file.  A changelist
        is effectively created the first time you label a file with
        that changelist; it is deleted when you remove that label from
        the last file that had it.  Let's examine a usage scenario
        that demonstrates these concepts.</para>

      <para>Harry is fixing some bugs in the calculator application's
        mathematics logic.  His work leads him to change a couple of
        files:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</screen>

      <para>While testing his bug fix, Harry notices that his changes
        bring to light a tangentially related bug in the user
        interface logic found in <filename>button.c</filename>.  Harry
        decides that he'll go ahead and fix that bug, too, as a
        separate commit from his math fixes.  Now, in a small working
        copy with only a handful of files and few logical changes,
        Harry can probably keep his two logical change groupings
        mentally organized without any problem.  But today he's going
        to use Subversion's changelists feature as a special favor to
        the authors of this book.</para>

      <para>Harry first creates a changelist and associates with it
        the two files he's already changed.  He does this by using the
        <command>svn changelist</command> command to assign the same
        arbitrary changelist name to those files:</para>

      <para>As you can see, the output of <command>svn
        status</command> reflects this new grouping.</para>

      <para>Harry now sets off to fix the secondary UI problem.  Since
        he knows which file he'll be changing, he assigns that path to
        a changelist, too.  Unfortunately, Harry carelessly assigns this
        third file to the same changelist as the previous two files:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn changelist math-fixes button.c
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-fixes'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
       button.c
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</screen>

      <para>Fortunately, Harry catches his mistake.  At this point, he
        has two options.  He can remove the changelist association
        from <filename>button.c</filename>, and then assign a
        different changelist name:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn changelist --remove button.c
Path 'button.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'ui-fix'.
$
</screen>

      <para>Or, he can skip the removal and just assign a new
        changelist name.  In this case, Subversion will first warn
        Harry that <filename>button.c</filename> is being removed from
        the first changelist:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn changelist ui-fix button.c
svn: warning: Removing 'button.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'button.c' is now a member of changelist 'ui-fix'.
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'ui-fix':
       button.c

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</screen>

      <para>Harry now has two distinct changelists present in his
        working copy, and <command>svn status</command> will group its
        output according to these changelist determinations.  Notice
        that even though Harry hasn't yet modified
        <filename>button.c</filename>, it still shows up in the output
        of <command>svn status</command> as interesting because it has
        a changelist assignment.  Changelists can be added to and
        removed from files at any time, regardless of whether they
        contain local modifications.</para>

      <para>Harry now fixes the user interface problem in
        <filename>button.c</filename>.</para>

      <screen>

      <title>Changelists As Operation Filters</title>

      <para>The visual grouping that Harry sees in the output of
        <command>svn status</command> as shown in our previous section
        is nice, but not entirely useful.  The
        <command>status</command> command is but one of many
        operations that he might wish to perform on his working copy.
        Fortunately, many of Subversion's other operations understand
        how to operate on changelists via the use of the
        <option>--changelist</option> option.</para>

      <para>When provided with a <option>--changelist</option> option,
        Subversion commands will limit the scope of their operation to
        only those files to which a particular changelist name is
        assigned.  If Harry now wants to see the actual changes he's
        made to the files in his <literal>math-fixes</literal>
        changelist, he <emphasis>could</emphasis> explicitly list only
        the files that make up that changelist on the <command>svn
        diff</command> command line.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn diff integer.c mathops.c
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)
+++ integer.c	(working copy)
&#x2026;
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>That works okay for a few files, but what if Harry's
        change touched 20 or 30 files?  That would be an annoyingly
        long list of explicitly named files.  Now that he's using
        changelists, though, Harry can avoid explicitly listing the
        set of files in his changelist from now on, and instead
        provide just the changelist name:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn diff --changelist math-fixes
Index: integer.c
===================================================================
--- integer.c	(revision 1157)
+++ integer.c	(working copy)
&#x2026;
Index: mathops.c
===================================================================
--- mathops.c	(revision 1157)
+++ mathops.c	(working copy)
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>And when it's time to commit, Harry can again use the
        <option>--changelist</option> option to limit the scope of the
        commit to files in a certain changelist.  He might commit his
        user interface fix by doing the following:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn ci -m "Fix a UI bug found while working on math logic." \
      --changelist ui-fix
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1158.
$
</screen>

      <para>In fact, the <command>svn commit</command> command
        provides a second changelists-related option:
        <option>--keep-changelists</option>.  Normally, changelist
        assignments are removed from files after they are committed.
        But if <option>--keep-changelists</option> is provided,
        Subversion will leave the changelist assignment on the
        committed (and now unmodified) files.  In any case, committing
        files assigned to one changelist leaves other changelists
        undisturbed.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status

--- Changelist 'math-fixes':
M      integer.c
M      mathops.c
$
</screen>

      <note>
        <para>The <option>--changelist</option> option acts only as a
          filter for Subversion command targets, and will not add
          targets to an operation.  For example, on a commit operation
          specified as <userinput>svn commit /path/to/dir</userinput>, the
          target is the directory <filename>/path/to/dir</filename>
          and its children (to infinite depth).  If you then add a
          changelist specifier to that command, only those files in
          and under <filename>/path/to/dir</filename> that are
          assigned that changelist name will be considered as targets
          of the commit&#x2014;the commit will not include files
          located elsewhere (such is in
          <filename>/path/to/another-dir</filename>), regardless of
          their changelist assignment, even if they are part of the
          same working copy as the operation's target(s).</para>
      </note>

      <para>Even the <command>svn changelist</command> command accepts
        the <option>--changelist</option> option.  This allows you to
        quickly and easily rename or remove a changelist:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn changelist math-bugs --changelist math-fixes --depth infinity .
svn: warning: Removing 'integer.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'integer.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-bugs'.
svn: warning: Removing 'mathops.c' from changelist 'math-fixes'.
Path 'mathops.c' is now a member of changelist 'math-bugs'.
$ svn changelist --remove --changelist math-bugs --depth infinity .
Path 'integer.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
Path 'mathops.c' is no longer a member of a changelist.
$
</screen>

      <para>Finally, you can specify multiple instances of the
        <option>--changelist</option> option on a single command
        line.  Doing so limits the operation you are performing to
        files found in any of the specified changesets.</para>

      <title>Changelist Limitations</title>

      <para>Subversion's changelist feature is a handy tool for
        grouping working copy files, but it does have a few limitations.
        Changelists are artifacts of a particular working copy, which
        means that changelist assignments cannot be propagated to the
        repository or otherwise shared with other users.  Changelists
        can be assigned only to files&#x2014;Subversion doesn't
        currently support the use of changelists with directories.
        Finally, you can have at most one changelist assignment on a
        given working copy file.  Here is where the blog post category
        and photo service tag analogies break down&#x2014;if you find
        yourself needing to assign a file to multiple changelists,

  <sect1 id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel">
    <title>Network Model</title>

    <para>At some point, you're going to need to understand how your
      Subversion client communicates with its server.  Subversion's
      networking layer is abstracted, meaning that Subversion clients
      exhibit the same general behaviors no matter what sort of server
      they are operating against.  Whether speaking the HTTP protocol
      (<literal>http://</literal>) with the Apache HTTP Server or
      speaking the custom Subversion protocol
      (<literal>svn://</literal>) with <command>svnserve</command>,
      the basic network model is the same.  In this section, we'll
      explain the basics of that network model, including how
      Subversion manages authentication and authorization
      matters.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.reqresp">
      <title>Requests and Responses</title>

      <para>The Subversion client spends most of its time managing
        working copies.  When it needs information from a remote
        repository, however, it makes a network request, and the
        server responds with an appropriate answer.  The details of
        the network protocol are hidden from the user&#x2014;the client
        attempts to access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a
        particular protocol is used to contact the server (see the sidebar <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.wc.sb-1"/>).</para>

      <tip><para>Run <userinput>svn --version</userinput> to see
        which URL schemes and protocols the client knows how to
        use.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>When the server process receives a client request, it
        often demands that the client identify itself.  It issues
        an authentication challenge to the client, and the client
        responds by providing <firstterm>credentials</firstterm> back
        to the server.  Once authentication is complete, the server
        responds with the original information that the client asked for.
        Notice that this system is different from systems such as CVS,
        where the client preemptively offers credentials (<quote>logs
        in</quote>) to the server before ever making a request.  In
        Subversion, the server <quote>pulls</quote> credentials by
        challenging the client at the appropriate moment, rather than
        the client <quote>pushing</quote> them.  This makes certain
        operations more elegant.  For example, if a server is
        configured to allow anyone in the world to read a repository,
        the server will never issue an authentication challenge
        when a client attempts to <command>svn checkout</command>.</para>

      <para>If the particular network requests issued by the client
        result in a new revision being created in the repository
        (e.g., <command>svn commit</command>), Subversion uses the
        authenticated username associated with those requests as the
        author of the revision.  That is, the authenticated user's
        name is stored as the value of the
        <literal>svn:author</literal> property on the new revision
        (see <xref linkend="svn.ref.properties"/>).  If
        the client was not authenticated (i.e., if the server
        never issued an authentication challenge), the revision's
        <literal>svn:author</literal> property is empty.
      </para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache">
      <title>Client Credentials Caching</title>

      <para>Many servers are configured to require authentication on
        every request.  This would be a big annoyance to users if
        they were forced to type their passwords over and over again.
        Fortunately, the Subversion client has a remedy for
        this&#x2014;a built-in system for caching authentication
        credentials on disk.  By default, whenever the command-line
        client successfully responds to a server's authentication
        challenge, credentials are cached on disk and keyed on a
        combination of the server's hostname, port, and authentication
        realm.</para>

      <para>When the client receives an authentication challenge, it
        first looks for the appropriate credentials in the user's disk
        cache.  If seemingly suitable credentials are not present, or
        if the cached credentials ultimately fail to authenticate,
        the client will, by default, fall back to prompting the
        user for the necessary information.</para>

      <para>The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately
        that there is reason for concern here.  <quote>Caching
        passwords on disk?  That's terrible!  You should never do
        that!</quote></para>

      <para>The Subversion developers recognize the legitimacy of such
        concerns, and so Subversion works with available mechanisms
        provided by the operating system and environment to try to
        minimize the risk of leaking this information.  Here's a
        breakdown of what this means for users on the most common
        platforms:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>On Windows, the Subversion client stores passwords
            in the <filename>%APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/</filename>
            directory. On Windows 2000 and later, the standard Windows
            cryptography services are used to encrypt the password
            on disk.  Because the encryption key is managed
            by Windows and is tied to the user's own login
            credentials, only the user can decrypt the cached
            password.  (Note that if the user's Windows account password
            is reset by an administrator, all of the cached passwords
            become undecipherable.  The Subversion client will behave
            as though they don't exist, prompting for passwords when
            required.)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores
            all repository passwords in the login keyring (managed by
            the Keychain service), which is protected by the user's
            account password.  User preference settings can impose
            additional policies, such as requiring that the user's account
            password be entered each time the Subversion password is
            used.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>For other Unix-like operating systems, no standard
            <quote>keychain</quote> services exist.  However, the
            Subversion client knows how to store password securely
            using the <quote>GNOME Keyring</quote> and
            <quote>KDE Wallet</quote> services.
            Also, before storing unencrypted passwords in the
            <filename>~/.subversion/auth/</filename> caching area,
            the Subversion client will ask the user for permission
            to do so.  Note that the <filename>auth/</filename>
            caching area is still permission-protected so that only
            the user (owner) can read data from it, not the world at
            large.  The operating system's own file permissions protect
            the passwords from other non-administrative users on the
            same system, provided they have no direct physical access
            to the storage media of the home directory, or backups
            thereof.</para>
        </listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these
        mechanisms meets the test of perfection.  So for those folks
        willing to sacrifice convenience for the ultimate in security,
        Subversion provides various ways of disabling its credentials
        caching system altogether.</para>

      <para>To disable caching for a single command, pass the
        <option>--no-auth-cache</option> option:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn commit -F log_msg.txt --no-auth-cache
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://host.example.com:3690&gt; example realm
Username:  joe
Password for 'joe':

Adding         newfile
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2324.

# password was not cached, so a second commit still prompts us

$ svn delete newfile
$ svn commit -F new_msg.txt
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://host.example.com:3690&gt; example realm
Username:  joe
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>Or, if you want to disable credential caching permanently,
        you can edit the <filename>config</filename> file in your
        runtime configuration area and set the
        <option>store-auth-creds</option> option to
        <literal>no</literal>.  This will prevent the storing of
        credentials used in any Subversion interactions you perform on
        the affected computer.  This can be extended to cover all
        users on the computer, too, by modifying the system-wide
        runtime configuration area (described in <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.layout"/>).</para>

      <screen>
[auth]
store-auth-creds = no
</screen>

      <para>Sometimes users will want to remove specific credentials
        from the disk cache.  To do this, you need to navigate into
        the <filename>auth/</filename> area and manually delete the
        appropriate cache file.  Credentials are cached in individual
        files;  if you look inside each file, you will see keys and
        values.  The <literal>svn:realmstring</literal> key describes
        the particular server realm that the file is associated
        with:</para>

      <screen>
$ ls ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/
5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28
3893ed123b39500bca8a0b382839198e
5c3c22968347b390f349ff340196ed39

$ cat ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/5671adf2865e267db74f09ba6f872c28

K 8

K 8
password
V 4
blah
K 15
svn:realmstring
V 45
&lt;https://svn.domain.com:443&gt; Joe's repository
END
</screen>

      <para>Once you have located the proper cache file, just delete
        it.</para>

      <para>One last word about <command>svn</command>'s
        authentication behavior, specifically regarding the
        <option>--username</option> and <option>--password</option>
        options.  Many client subcommands accept these options, but it
        is important to understand that using these options does
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> automatically send credentials to the
        server.  As discussed earlier, the server <quote>pulls</quote>
        credentials from the client when it deems necessary; the
        client cannot <quote>push</quote> them at will.  If a username
        and/or password are passed as options, they will be
        presented to the server only if the server requests them.  These
        options are typically used to authenticate as a different user
        than Subversion would have chosen by default (such as your
        system login name) or when trying to avoid interactive
        prompting (such as when calling <command>svn</command> from a
        script).</para>

      <note>
        <para>A common mistake is to misconfigure a server so
          that it never issues an authentication challenge.  When
          users pass <option>--username</option> and
          <option>--password</option> options to the client, they're
          surprised to see that they're never used; that is, new
          revisions still appear to have been committed
          anonymously!</para>
      </note>

      <para>Here is a final summary that describes how a Subversion
        client behaves when it receives an authentication
        challenge.</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>First, the client checks whether the user specified
            any credentials as command-line options
            (<option>--username</option> and/or
            <option>--password</option>).  If so, the client will try
            to use those credentials to authenticate against the
            server.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If no command-line credentials were provided, or the
            provided ones were invalid, the client looks up the server's
            hostname, port, and realm in the runtime configuration's
            <filename>auth/</filename> area, to see whether appropriate 
            credentials are cached there.  If so, it attempts to use
            those credentials to authenticate.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Finally, if the previous mechanisms failed to
            successfully authenticate the user against the server, the
            client resorts to interactively prompting the user for
            valid credentials (unless instructed not to do so via the
            <option>--non-interactive</option> option or its
            client-specific equivalents).</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the client successfully authenticates by any of these
        methods, it will attempt to cache the credentials on disk
        (unless the user has disabled this behavior, as mentioned
        earlier).</para>

    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>After reading this chapter, you should have a firm grasp on
      some of Subversion's features that, while perhaps not used
      <emphasis>every</emphasis> time you interact with your version
      control system, are certainly handy to know about.  But don't
      stop here!  Read on to the following chapter, where you'll learn

  <para>Branching, tagging, and merging are concepts common to
    almost all version control systems.  If you're not familiar with
    these ideas, we provide a good introduction in this chapter.  If
    you are familiar, hopefully you'll find it interesting to
    see how Subversion implements them.</para>

  <para>Branching is a fundamental part of version control.  If
    you're going to allow Subversion to manage your data, this
    is a feature you'll eventually come to depend on.  This chapter
    assumes that you're already familiar with Subversion's basic
    concepts (<xref linkend="svn.basic"/>).</para>

    <title>What's a Branch?</title>

    <para>Suppose it's your job to maintain a document for a division
      in your company&#x2014;a handbook of some sort.  One day a different
      division asks you for the same handbook, but with a few parts
      <quote>tweaked</quote> for them, since they do things slightly
      differently.</para>

    <para>What do you do in this situation?  You do the obvious: make
      a second copy of your document and begin maintaining the two
      copies separately.  As each department asks you to make small
      changes, you incorporate them into one copy or the other.</para>

    <para>You often want to make the same change to both copies.  For
      example, if you discover a typo in the first copy, it's very
      likely that the same typo exists in the second copy.  The two
      documents are almost the same, after all; they differ only in
      small, specific ways.</para>

    <para>This is the basic concept of a
      <firstterm>branch</firstterm>&#x2014;namely, a line of
      development that exists independently of another line, yet still
      shares a common history if you look far enough back in time.  A
      branch always begins life as a copy of something, and moves on
      from there, generating its own history (see <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.whatis.dia-1"/>).</para>

      </figure>

    <para>Subversion has commands to help you maintain parallel
      branches of your files and directories.  It allows you to create
      branches by copying your data, and remembers that the copies are
      related to one another.  It also helps you duplicate changes
      from one branch to another.  Finally, it can make portions of
      your working copy reflect different branches so that you can
      <quote>mix and match</quote> different lines of development in
      your daily work.</para>

    <title>Using Branches</title>

    <para>At this point, you should understand how each commit creates
      an entirely new filesystem tree (called a <quote>revision</quote>)
      in the repository.  If you don't, go back and read about revisions in
      <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.revs"/>.</para>

    <para>For this chapter, we'll go back to the same example from
      <xref linkend="svn.basic"/>.  Remember that you and your
      collaborator, Sally, are sharing a repository that contains two
      projects, <filename>paint</filename> and
      <filename>calc</filename>.  Notice that in <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1"/>, however, each project
      directory now contains subdirectories named
      <filename>trunk</filename> and <filename>branches</filename>.
      The reason for this will soon become clear.</para>

      <figure id="svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1">
        <title>Starting repository layout</title>
        <graphic fileref="images/ch04dia2.png"/>
      </figure>

    <para>As before, assume that Sally and you both have working
      copies of the <quote>calc</quote> project.  Specifically, you
      each have a working copy of <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>.
      All the files for the project are in this subdirectory rather
      than in <filename>/calc</filename> itself, because your team has
      decided that <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> is where the
      <quote>main line</quote> of development is going to take
      place.</para>

    <para>Let's say that you've been given the task of implementing a
      large software feature.  It will take a long time to write, and
      will affect all the files in the project.  The immediate problem
      is that you don't want to interfere with Sally, who is in the
      process of fixing small bugs here and there.  She's depending on
      the fact that the latest version of the project (in
      <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>) is always usable.  If you
      start committing your changes bit by bit, you'll surely break
      things for Sally (and other team members as well).</para>

    <para>One strategy is to crawl into a hole: you and Sally can stop
      sharing information for a week or two.  That is, start gutting
      and reorganizing all the files in your working copy, but don't
      commit or update until you're completely finished with the task.
      There are a number of problems with this, though.  First, it's
      not very safe.  Most people like to save their work to the
      repository frequently, should something bad accidentally happen
      to their working copy.  Second, it's not very flexible.  If you
      do your work on different computers (perhaps you have a working
      copy of <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> on two different
      machines), you'll need to manually copy your changes back and
      forth or just do all the work on a single computer.  By that
      same token, it's difficult to share your changes in progress
      with anyone else.  A common software development <quote>best
      practice</quote> is to allow your peers to review your work as
      you go.  If nobody sees your intermediate commits, you lose
      potential feedback and may end up going down the wrong path for
      weeks before another person on your team notices.  Finally, when
      you're finished with all your changes, you might find it very
      difficult to remerge your final work with the rest of the
      company's main body of code.  Sally (or others) may have made
      many other changes in the repository that are difficult to
      incorporate into your working copy&#x2014;especially if you
      run <command>svn update</command> after weeks of
      isolation.</para>

    <para>The better solution is to create your own branch, or line of
      development, in the repository.  This allows you to save your
      half-broken work frequently without interfering with others, yet
      you can still selectively share information with your
      collaborators.  You'll see exactly how this works as we go.

    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.using.create">
      <title>Creating a Branch</title>

      <para>Creating a branch is very simple&#x2014;you make a copy of
        the project in the repository using the <command>svn
        copy</command> command.  Subversion is able to copy not only 
        single files, but whole directories as well.  In this case,
        you want to make a copy of the
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> directory.  Where should the
        new copy live?  Wherever you wish&#x2014;it's a matter of
        project policy.  Let's say that your team has a policy of
        creating branches in the <filename>/calc/branches</filename>
        area of the repository, and you want to name your branch
        <literal>my-calc-branch</literal>.  You'll want to create a
        new directory,
        <filename>/calc/branches/my-calc-branch</filename>, which
        begins its life as a copy of
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>.</para>

      <para>You may already have seen <command>svn copy</command> used
        to copy one file to another within a working copy.  But it can
        also be used to do a <quote>remote</quote> copy entirely
        within the repository.  Just copy one URL to another:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk."

Committed revision 341.
</screen>

      <para>This command causes a near-instantaneous commit in the
        repository, creating a new directory in revision 341.  The new
        directory is a copy of <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>.  This
        is shown in
        <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1"/>.
        <footnote>
        <para>Subversion does not support copying between different
        repositories.  When using URLs with <command>svn
        copy</command> or <command>svn move</command>, you can only
        copy items within the same repository.</para> 
        </footnote>

        While it's also possible to create a branch by
        using <command>svn copy</command> to duplicate a directory
        within the working copy, this technique isn't recommended.  It
        can be quite slow, in fact!  Copying a directory on the
        client side is a linear-time operation, in that it actually
        has to duplicate every file and subdirectory on the local disk.
        Copying a directory on the server, however, is a constant-time
        operation, and it's the way most people create
        branches.</para>

        <title>Cheap Copies</title>

        <para>Subversion's repository has a special design.  When you
          copy a directory, you don't need to worry about the
          repository growing huge&#x2014;Subversion doesn't actually
          duplicate any data.  Instead, it creates a new directory
          entry that points to an <emphasis>existing</emphasis> tree.
          If you're an experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as
          the same concept behind a hard link.  As further changes are
          made to files and directories beneath the copied directory,
          Subversion continues to employ this hard link concept where
          it can.  It duplicates data only when it is necessary to
          disambiguate different versions of objects.</para>

        <para>This is why you'll often hear Subversion users talk
          about <quote>cheap copies.</quote>  It doesn't matter how
          large the directory is&#x2014;it takes a very tiny, constant
          amount of time and space to make a copy of it.  In fact,
          this feature is the basis of how commits work in Subversion:
          each revision is a <quote>cheap copy</quote> of the previous
          revision, with a few items lazily changed within.  (To read
          more about this, visit Subversion's web site and read about
          the <quote>bubble up</quote> method in Subversion's design
          documents.)</para>

        <para>Of course, these internal mechanics of copying and
          sharing data are hidden from the user, who simply sees
          copies of trees.  The main point here is that copies are
          cheap, both in time and in space.  If you create a branch
          entirely within the repository (by running <userinput>svn copy
          <replaceable>URL1</replaceable> <replaceable>URL2</replaceable></userinput>), it's a quick, constant-time operation.
          Make branches as often as you want.</para>

        <emphasis>does</emphasis> show that the two files share a
        common history.  Before the branch copy was made in revision
        341, the files used to be the same file.  That's why you and
        Sally both see the changes made in revisions 303 and
        98.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.using.concepts">
      <title>The Key Concepts Behind Branching</title> 

      <para>You should remember two important lessons
        from this section.  First, Subversion has no internal concept
        of a branch&#x2014;it knows only how to make copies.  When you
        copy a directory, the resultant directory is only
        a <quote>branch</quote> because <emphasis>you</emphasis>
        attach that meaning to it.  You may think of the directory
        differently, or treat it differently, but to Subversion it's
        just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some extra
        historical information.</para>

      <para>Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's
        branches exist as <emphasis>normal filesystem
        directories</emphasis> in the repository.  This is different
        from other version control systems, where branches are
        typically defined by adding
        extra-dimensional <quote>labels</quote> to collections of
        files.  The location of your branch directory doesn't matter
        to Subversion.  Most teams follow a convention of putting all
        branches into a <filename>/branches</filename> directory, but
        you're free to invent any policy you wish.</para>

    </sect2>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging">
    <title>Basic Merging</title>

    <para>Now you and Sally are working on parallel branches of the
      project: you're working on a private branch, and Sally is
      working on the <firstterm>trunk</firstterm>, or main line of
      development.</para>

    <para>For projects that have a large number of contributors, it's
      common for most people to have working copies of the trunk.
      Whenever someone needs to make a long-running change that is
      likely to disrupt the trunk, a standard procedure is to create a
      private branch and commit changes there until all the work is
      complete.</para>

    <para>So, the good news is that you and Sally aren't interfering
      with each other.  The bad news is that it's very easy to drift
      <emphasis>too</emphasis> far apart.  Remember that one of the
      problems with the <quote>crawl in a hole</quote> strategy is
      that by the time you're finished with your branch, it may be
      near-impossible to merge your changes back into the trunk
      without a huge number of conflicts.</para>

    <para>Instead, you and Sally might continue to share changes as
      you work.  It's up to you to decide which changes are worth
      sharing; Subversion gives you the ability to selectively
      <quote>copy</quote> changes between branches.  And when you're
      completely finished with your branch, your entire set of branch
      changes can be copied back into the trunk.  In Subversion
      terminology, the general act of replicating changes from one
      branch to another is called <firstterm>merging</firstterm>, and
      it is performed using various invocations of the <command>svn
      merge</command> command.</para>

    <para>In the examples that follow, we're assuming that both your
      Subversion client and server are running Subversion 1.5 (or
      later).  If either client or server is older than version 1.5,
      things are more complicated: the system won't track changes
      automatically, and you'll have to use painful manual methods to
      achieve similar results.  That is, you'll always need to use the
      detailed merge syntax to specify specific ranges of revisions to
      replicate (see
      <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax"/> later
      in this chapter), and take special care to keep track of what's
      already been merged and what hasn't.  For this reason,
      we <emphasis>strongly</emphasis> recommend that you make sure your
      client and server are at least at version 1.5.</para>

  <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.changesets">
      <title>Changesets</title>

      <para>Before we proceed further, we should warn you that there's
        going to be a lot of discussion of <quote>changes</quote> in
        the pages ahead.  A lot of people experienced with version
        control systems use the terms <quote>change</quote>
        and <quote>changeset</quote> interchangeably, and we should
        clarify what Subversion understands as
        a <firstterm>changeset</firstterm>.</para>

      <para>Everyone seems to have a slightly different definition
        of changeset, or at least a different
        expectation of what it means for a version control system to
        have one.  For our purposes, let's say that a changeset is just
        a collection of changes with a unique name.  The changes might
        include textual edits to file contents, modifications to tree
        structure, or tweaks to metadata.  In more common speak, a
        changeset is just a patch with a name you can refer to.</para>

      <para>In Subversion, a global revision number N names a tree in
        the repository: it's the way the repository looked after the
        Nth commit.  It's also the name of an implicit changeset: if
        you compare tree N with tree N&#x2212;1, you can derive the exact
        patch that was committed.  For this reason, it's easy to think
        of revision N as not just a tree, but a changeset as well.  If
        you use an issue tracker to manage bugs, you can use the
        revision numbers to refer to particular patches that fix
        bugs&#x2014;for example,
        <quote>this issue was fixed by r9238.</quote> Somebody
        can then run <userinput>svn log -r 9238</userinput> to read about
        the exact changeset that fixed the bug, and run
        <userinput>svn diff -c 9238</userinput> to see the patch itself.
        And (as you'll see shortly)
        Subversion's <command>svn merge</command> command is able to use
        revision numbers.  You can merge specific changesets from one
        branch to another by naming them in the merge
        arguments: passing <userinput>-c 9238</userinput> to <command>svn merge</command> would merge
        changeset r9238 into your working copy.</para>

      <title>Keeping a Branch in Sync</title>

      <para>Continuing with our running example, let's suppose that a
        week has passed since you started working on your private
        branch.  Your new feature isn't finished yet, but at the same
        time you know that other people on your team have continued to
        make important changes in the
        project's <filename>/trunk</filename>.  It's in your best
        interest to replicate those changes to your own branch, just
        to make sure they mesh well with your changes.  In fact, this
        is a best practice: frequently keeping your branch in sync
        with the main development line helps
        prevent <quote>surprise</quote> conflicts when it comes time
        for you to fold your changes back into the trunk.</para>

      <para>Subversion is aware of the history of your branch and
        knows when it divided away from the trunk.  To replicate the
        latest, greatest trunk changes to your branch, first make sure
        your working copy of the branch
        is <quote>clean</quote>&#x2014;that it has no local
        modifications reported by <command>svn status</command>.  Then
        simply run:</para>

      <screen>
$ pwd
/home/user/my-calc-branch

$ svn merge ^/trunk
--- Merging r345 through r356 into '.':
U    button.c
U    integer.c
</screen>

      <para>This basic syntax&#x2014;<userinput>svn merge
        <replaceable>URL</replaceable></userinput>&#x2014;tells
        Subversion to merge all recent changes from the URL to the
        current working directory (which is typically the root of your
        working copy).  Also notice that we're using the caret
        (<literal>^</literal>) syntax<footnote><para>This was
        introduced in svn 1.6.</para></footnote> to avoid having to
        type out the entire <filename>/trunk</filename> URL.</para>

      <para>After running the prior example, your branch working copy
        now contains new local modifications, and these edits are
        duplications of all of the changes that have happened on the
        trunk since you first created your branch:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
 M     .
M      button.c
M      integer.c
</screen>

      <para>At this point, the wise thing to do is look at the changes
        carefully with <command>svn diff</command>, and then build and
        test your branch.  Notice that the current working directory
        (<quote><filename>.</filename></quote>) has also been
        modified; the <command>svn diff</command> will show that
        its <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> property has been either
        created or modified.  This is important merge-related metadata
        that you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> touch, since it will
        be needed by future <command>svn merge</command> commands.
        (We'll learn more about this metadata later in the
        chapter.)</para>

      <para>After performing the merge, you might also need to resolve
        some conflicts (just as you do with <command>svn
        update</command>) or possibly make some small edits to get
        things working properly.  (Remember, just because there are
        no <emphasis>syntactic</emphasis> conflicts doesn't mean there
        aren't any <emphasis>semantic</emphasis> conflicts!)  If you
        encounter serious problems, you can always abort the local
        changes by running <userinput>svn revert . -R</userinput> (which
        will undo all local modifications) and start a
        long <quote>what's going on?</quote> discussion with your
        collaborators.  If things look good, however, you can
        submit these changes into the repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn commit -m "Merged latest trunk changes to my-calc-branch."
Sending        .
Sending        button.c
Sending        integer.c
Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 357.
</screen>

      <para>At this point, your private branch is now <quote>in
          sync</quote> with the trunk, so you can rest easier knowing
          that as you continue to work in isolation, you're not
          drifting too far away from what everyone else is
          doing.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Why Not Use Patches Instead?</title>

        <para>A question may be on your mind, especially if you're a
          Unix user: why bother to use <command>svn merge</command> at
          all?  Why not simply use the operating system's
          <command>patch</command> command to accomplish the same job?
          For example:</para>

        <screen>
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn diff -r 341:HEAD ^/trunk &gt; patchfile
$ patch -p0  &lt; patchfile
Patching file integer.c using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 147.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 164.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 241.
Hunk #4 succeeded at 249.
done
</screen>

        <para>In this particular example, there really isn't much
          difference.  But <command>svn merge</command> has special
          abilities that surpass the <command>patch</command> program.
          The file format used by <command>patch</command> is quite
          limited; it's able to tweak file contents only.  There's no
          way to represent changes to <emphasis>trees</emphasis>, such
          as the addition, removal, or renaming of files and
          directories.  Nor can the <command>patch</command> program
          notice changes to properties.  If Sally's change had,
          say, added a new directory, the output of <command>svn
          diff</command> wouldn't have mentioned it at
          all.  <command>svn diff</command> outputs only the limited
          patch format, so there are some ideas it simply can't
          express.</para>

        <para>The <command>svn merge</command> command, however, can
          express changes in tree structure and properties by directly
          applying them to your working copy.  Even more important,
          this command records the changes that have been duplicated
          to your branch so that Subversion is aware of exactly which
          changes exist in each location (see
          <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo"/>.)
          This is a critical feature that makes branch management
          usable; without it, users would have to manually keep notes
          on which sets of changes have or haven't been merged
          yet.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Suppose that another week has passed.  You've committed
        more changes to your branch, and your comrades have continued
        to improve the trunk as well.  Once again, you'd like to
        replicate the latest trunk changes to your branch and bring
        yourself in sync.  Just run the same merge command
        again!</para>

      <screen>
$ svn merge ^/trunk
--- Merging r357 through r380 into '.':
U    integer.c
U    Makefile

</screen>

      <para>Subversion knows which trunk changes you've already
        replicated to your branch, so it carefully replicates only
        those changes you don't yet have.  Once again, you'll have to
        build, test, and <command>svn commit</command> the local
        modifications to your branch.</para>

      <para>What happens when you finally finish your work, though?
        Your new feature is done, and you're ready to merge your
        branch changes back to the trunk (so your team can enjoy the
        bounty of your labor).  The process is simple.  First, bring
        your branch in sync with the trunk again, just as you've been
        doing all along:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn merge ^/trunk
--- Merging r381 through r385 into '.':

Transmitting file data ..
Committed revision 390.
</screen>

      <para>Now, you use <command>svn merge</command> to replicate
        your branch changes back into the trunk.  You'll need an
        up-to-date working copy of <filename>/trunk</filename>.  You
        can do this by either doing an <command>svn
        checkout</command>, dredging up an old trunk working copy from
        somewhere on your disk, or using <command>svn 
        switch</command> (see
        <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.switchwc"/>.) However you get a
        trunk working copy, remember that it's a best practice to do
        your merge into a working copy that
        has <emphasis>no</emphasis> local edits and has been recently
        updated (i.e., is not a mixture of local revisions).  If your
        working copy isn't <quote>clean</quote> in these ways, you can
        run into some unnecessary conflict-related headaches
        and <command>svn merge</command> will likely return an
        error.</para>

      <para>Once you have a clean working copy of the trunk, you're
        ready to merge your branch back into it:</para>

      <screen>

</screen>

      <para>Congratulations, your branch has now been remerged back
        into the main line of development.  Notice our use of
        the <option>--reintegrate</option> option this time around.
        The option is critical for reintegrating changes from a branch
        back into its original line of development&#x2014;don't forget
        it!  It's needed because this sort of <quote>merge
        back</quote> is a different sort of work than what you've been
        doing up until now.  Previously, we had been
        asking <command>svn merge</command> to grab the <quote>next
        set</quote> of changes from one line of development (the
        trunk) and duplicate them to another (your branch).  This is
        fairly straightforward, and each time Subversion knows how to
        pick up where it left off.  In our prior examples, you can see
        that first it merges the ranges 345:356 from trunk to branch;
        later on, it continues by merging the next contiguously
        available range, 356:380.  When doing the final sync, it
        merges the range 380:385.</para>

      <para>When merging your branch back to the trunk, however, the
        underlying mathematics is quite different.  Your feature
        branch is now a mishmosh of both duplicated trunk changes and
        private branch changes, so there's no simple contiguous range
        of revisions to copy over.  By specifying
        the <option>--reintegrate</option> option, you're asking
        Subversion to carefully replicate <emphasis>only</emphasis>
        those changes unique to your branch.  (And in fact, it does
        this by comparing the latest trunk tree with the latest branch
        tree:  the resulting difference is exactly your branch
        changes!)</para>

      <para>Now that your private branch is merged to trunk, you may
        wish to remove it from the repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn delete ^/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.
</screen>

      <para>But wait!  Isn't the history of that branch valuable?
        What if somebody wants to audit the evolution of your feature
        someday and look at all of your branch changes?  No need to
        worry.  Remember that even though your branch is no longer
        visible in the <filename>/branches</filename> directory, its
        existence is still an immutable part of the repository's
        history.  A simple <command>svn log</command> command on
        the <filename>/branches</filename> URL will show the entire
        history of your branch.  Your branch can even be resurrected
        at some point, should you desire (see
        <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.resurrect"/>).</para>

      <para>In Subversion 1.5, once
        a <option>--reintegrate</option> merge is done from branch to trunk,
        the branch is no longer usable for further work.  It's not
        able to correctly absorb new trunk changes, nor can it be
        properly reintegrated to trunk again.  For this reason, if you
        want to keep working on your feature branch, we recommend
        destroying it and then re-creating it from the trunk:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Remove my-calc-branch."
Committed revision 392.

$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/new-branch
      -m "Create a new branch from trunk."
Committed revision 393.

$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn switch ^/branches/new-branch
Updated to revision 393.
</screen>

      <para>The final command in the prior example&#x2014;<command>svn
        switch</command>&#x2014;is a way of updating an existing working
        copy to reflect a different repository directory.  We'll discuss
        this more in <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.switchwc"/>.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.mergeinfo">
      <title>Mergeinfo and Previews</title>

      <para>The basic mechanism Subversion uses to track
        changesets&#x2014;that is, which changes have been merged to
        which branches&#x2014;is by recording data in properties.
        Specifically, merge data is tracked in
        the <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> property attached to
        files and directories.  (If you're not familiar with
        Subversion properties, now is the time to skim
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props"/>.)</para>

      <para>You can examine the property, just like any
        other:</para>

      <screen>
$ cd my-calc-branch
$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:341-390
</screen>

      <para>It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> recommended that you change
        the value of this property yourself, unless you really know
        what you're doing.  This property is automatically maintained
        by Subversion whenever you run <command>svn merge</command>.
        Its value indicates which changes (at a given path) have been
        replicated into the directory in question.  In this case, the
        path is <filename>/trunk</filename> and the directory which
        has received the specific changes
        is <filename>/branches/my-calc-branch</filename>.</para>

      <para>There's also a subcommand, <command>svn
        mergeinfo</command>, which can be helpful in seeing not only
        which changesets a directory has absorbed, but also which
        changesets it's still eligible to receive.  This gives a sort
        of preview of the next set of changes that <command>svn
        merge</command> will replicate to your branch.</para>

      <screen>
$ cd my-calc-branch

# Which changes have already been merged from trunk to branch?
$ svn mergeinfo ^/trunk
r341
r342
r343
&#x2026;
r388
r389
r390

# Which changes are still eligible to merge from trunk to branch?
$ svn mergeinfo ^/trunk --show-revs eligible
r391
r392
r393
r394
r395
</screen>

      <para>The <command>svn mergeinfo</command> command requires
        a <quote>source</quote> URL (where the changes would be coming
        from), and takes an optional <quote>target</quote> URL (where
        the changes would be merged to).  If no target URL is given,
        it assumes that the current working directory is the
        target.  In the prior example, because we're querying our
        branch working copy, the command assumes we're interested in
        receiving changes to <filename>/branches/mybranch</filename>
        from the specified trunk URL.</para>

      <para>Another way to get a more precise preview of a merge
        operation is to use the <option>--dry-run</option>
        option:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn merge ^/trunk --dry-run
U    integer.c

$ svn status
#  nothing printed, working copy is still unchanged.
</screen>

      <para>The <option>--dry-run</option> option doesn't actually
        apply any local changes to the working copy.  It shows only
        status codes that <emphasis>would</emphasis> be printed in a
        real merge.  It's useful for getting a <quote>high-level</quote>
        preview of the potential merge, for those times
        when running <command>svn diff</command> gives too much
        detail.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>After performing a merge operation, but before committing
          the results of the merge, you can use <userinput>svn diff
          --depth=empty <replaceable>/path/to/merge/target</replaceable></userinput> to see only
          the changes to the immediate target of your merge.  If your
          merge target was a directory, only property differences will
          be displayed.  This is a handy way to see the changes to the
          <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> property recorded by the
          merge operation, which will remind you about what you've
          just merged.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Of course, the best way to preview a merge operation is to
        just do it!  Remember, running <command>svn merge</command>
        isn't an inherently risky thing (unless you've made local
        modifications to your working copy&#x2014;but we've already
        stressed that you shouldn't be merging into such an
        environment).  If you don't like the results of the merge,
        simply run <userinput>svn revert . -R</userinput> to revert the changes from
        your working copy and retry the command with different
        options.  The merge isn't final until you
        actually <command>svn commit</command> the results.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>While it's perfectly fine to experiment with merges by
          running <command>svn merge</command> and <command>svn
          revert</command> over and over, you may run into some
          annoying (but easily bypassed) roadblocks.  For example, if
          the merge operation adds a new file (i.e., schedules it for
          addition), <command>svn revert</command> won't actually
          remove the file; it simply unschedules the addition.  You're
          left with an unversioned file.  If you then attempt to run
          the merge again, you may get conflicts due to the
          unversioned file <quote>being in the way.</quote> Solution?
          After performing a revert, be sure to clean up the working
          copy and remove unversioned files and directories.  The
          output of <command>svn status</command> should be as clean
          as possible, ideally showing no output.</para>
      </tip>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo">
      <title>Undoing Changes</title>

      <para>An extremely common use for <command>svn merge</command>
        is to roll back a change that has already been committed.
        Suppose you're working away happily on a working copy of
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>, and you discover that the
        change made way back in revision 303, which changed
        <filename>integer.c</filename>, is completely wrong.  It never
        should have been committed.  You can use <command>svn
        merge</command> to <quote>undo</quote> the change in your
        working copy, and then commit the local modification to the
        repository.  All you need to do is to specify a
        <emphasis>reverse</emphasis> difference.  (You can do this by
        specifying <option>--revision 303:302</option>, or by an
        equivalent <option>--change -303</option>.)</para>

      <para>As we mentioned earlier, one way to think about a

        <option>-r</option> option, you can ask <command>svn
        merge</command> to apply a changeset, or a whole range of
        changesets, to your working copy.  In our case of undoing a
        change, we're asking <command>svn merge</command> to apply
        changeset #303 to our working copy
        <emphasis>backward</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Keep in mind that rolling back a change like this is just
        like any other <command>svn merge</command> operation, so you
        should use <command>svn status</command> and <command>svn
        diff</command> to confirm that your work is in the state you
        want it to be in, and then use <command>svn commit</command>
        to send the final version to the repository.  After
        committing, this particular changeset is no longer reflected
        in the <literal>HEAD</literal> revision.</para>

      <para>Again, you may be thinking: well, that really didn't undo
        the commit, did it?  The change still exists in revision 303.
        If somebody checks out a version of the
        <filename>calc</filename> project between revisions 303 and
        349, she'll still see the bad change, right?</para>

      <para>Yes, that's true.  When we talk about
        <quote>removing</quote> a change, we're really talking about
        removing it from the <literal>HEAD</literal> revision.  The
        original change still exists in the repository's history.  For
        most situations, this is good enough.  Most people are only
        interested in tracking the <literal>HEAD</literal> of a
        project anyway.  There are special cases, however, where you
        really might want to destroy all evidence of the commit.
        (Perhaps somebody accidentally committed a confidential
        document.)  This isn't so easy, it turns out, because
        Subversion was deliberately designed to never lose
        information.  Revisions are immutable trees that build upon
        one another.  Removing a revision from history would cause a
        domino effect, creating chaos in all subsequent revisions and
        possibly invalidating all working copies.
        <footnote>
          <para>The Subversion project has plans, however, to someday
            implement a command that would accomplish the task of
            permanently deleting information.  In the meantime, see
            <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.tk.svndumpfilter"/>

      <title>Resurrecting Deleted Items</title>

      <para>The great thing about version control systems is that
        information is never lost.  Even when you delete a file or
        directory, it may be gone from the <literal>HEAD</literal>
        revision, but the object still exists in earlier revisions.
        One of the most common questions new users ask is, <quote>How
        do I get my old file or directory back?</quote></para>

      <para>The first step is to define
        exactly <emphasis>which</emphasis> item you're
        trying to resurrect.  Here's a useful metaphor: you can think
        of every object in the repository as existing in a sort of
        two-dimensional coordinate system.  The first coordinate is a
        particular revision tree, and the second coordinate is a path
        within that tree.  So every version of your file or directory
        can be defined by a specific coordinate pair.  (Remember the
        <quote>peg revision</quote>
        syntax&#x2014;foo.c@224&#x2014;mentioned back in
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.pegrevs"/>.) </para>

      <para>First, you might need to use <command>svn log</command> to
        discover the exact coordinate pair you wish to resurrect.  A
        good strategy is to run <userinput>svn log --verbose</userinput>
        in a directory that used to contain your deleted item.  The
        <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>) option shows
        a list of all changed items in each revision; all you need to
        do is find the revision in which you deleted the file or
        directory.  You can do this visually, or by using another tool
        to examine the log output (via <command>grep</command>, or
        perhaps via an incremental search in an editor).</para>

   M /calc/trunk/integer.c

Added fast fourier transform functions to integer.c.
Removed real.c because code now in double.c.
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>In the example, we're assuming that you're looking for a
        deleted file <filename>real.c</filename>.  By looking through
        the logs of a parent directory, you've spotted that this file
        was deleted in revision 808.  Therefore, the last version of
        the file to exist was in the revision right before that.
        Conclusion: you want to resurrect the path
        <filename>/calc/trunk/real.c</filename> from revision
        807.</para>

      <para>That was the hard part&#x2014;the research.  Now that you
        know what you want to restore, you have two different
        choices.</para>

      <para>One option is to use <command>svn merge</command> to apply
        revision 808 <quote>in reverse.</quote> (We already
        discussed how to undo changes in
        <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo"/>.)  This
        would have the effect of re-adding <filename>real.c</filename>
        as a local modification.  The file would be scheduled for
        addition, and after a commit, the file would again exist
        in <literal>HEAD</literal>.</para>

      <para>In this particular example, however, this is probably not
        the best strategy.  Reverse-applying revision 808 would not
        only schedule <filename>real.c</filename> for addition, but
        the log message indicates that it would also undo certain
        changes to <filename>integer.c</filename>, which you don't
        want.  Certainly, you could reverse-merge revision 808 and
        then <command>svn revert</command> the local modifications to
        <filename>integer.c</filename>, but this technique doesn't
        scale well.  What if 90 files were changed in revision
        808?</para>

      <para>A second, more targeted strategy is not to use
        <command>svn merge</command> at all, but rather to use the
        <command>svn copy</command> command.  Simply copy the exact
        revision and path <quote>coordinate pair</quote> from the
        repository to your working copy:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy ^/trunk/real.c@807 ./real.c

$ svn status
A  +   real.c

$ svn commit -m "Resurrected real.c from revision 807, /calc/trunk/real.c."
Adding         real.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1390.
</screen>

      <para>The plus sign in the status output indicates that the item
        isn't merely scheduled for addition, but scheduled for
        addition <quote>with history.</quote>  Subversion remembers
        where it was copied from.  In the future, running <command>svn
        log</command> on this file will traverse back through the
        file's resurrection and through all the history it had prior
        to revision 807.  In other words, this new
        <filename>real.c</filename> isn't really new; it's a direct
        descendant of the original, deleted file.  This is usually
        considered a good and useful thing.  If, however, you wanted
        to resurrect the file <emphasis>without</emphasis>
        maintaining a historical link to the old file, this technique
        works just as well:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn cat ^/trunk/real.c@807 &gt; ./real.c

$ svn add real.c
A         real.c

$ svn commit -m "Re-created real.c from revision 807."
Adding         real.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1390.
</screen>

      <para>Although our example shows us resurrecting a file, note
        that these same techniques work just as well for resurrecting
        deleted directories.  Also note that a resurrection doesn't
        have to happen in your working copy&#x2014;it can happen
        entirely in the repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy ^/trunk/real.c@807 ^/trunk/ \
      -m "Resurrect real.c from revision 807."
Committed revision 1390.

    <para>Here ends the automated magic.  Sooner or later, once you
      get the hang of branching and merging, you're going to have to
      ask Subversion to merge <emphasis>specific</emphasis> changes
      from one place to another.  To do this, you're going to
      have to start passing more complicated arguments to <command>svn
      merge</command>.  The next section describes the fully expanded
      syntax of the command and discusses a number of common
      scenarios that require it.</para>

      <title>Cherrypicking</title>

      <para>Just as the term <quote>changeset</quote> is often used in
        version control systems, so is the term
        <firstterm>cherrypicking</firstterm>.  This word refers to
        the act of choosing <emphasis>one</emphasis> specific
        changeset from a branch and replicating it to another.
        Cherrypicking may also refer to the act of duplicating a
        particular set of (not necessarily contiguous!) changesets
        from one branch to another.  This is in contrast to more
        typical merging scenarios, where the <quote>next</quote>
        contiguous range of revisions is duplicated
        automatically.</para>

      <para>Why would people want to replicate just a single change?
        It comes up more often than you'd think.  For example, let's
        go back in time and imagine that you haven't yet merged your
        private feature branch back to the trunk.  At the
        water cooler, you get word that Sally made an interesting
        change to <filename>integer.c</filename> on the trunk.
        Looking over the history of commits to the trunk, you see that
        in revision 355 she fixed a critical bug that directly
        impacts the feature you're working on.  You might not be ready
        to merge all the trunk changes to your branch just yet, but
        you certainly need that particular bug fix in order to continue
        your work.</para>

      <para>Just as you used <command>svn diff</command> in the prior

      <para>You can now go through the usual testing procedures before

        branch with the trunk know to skip over r355.  (Merging the

      <para>This use case of replicating
        (or <firstterm>backporting</firstterm>) bug fixes from one
        branch to another is perhaps the most popular reason for
        cherrypicking changes; it comes up all the time, for example,
        when a team is maintaining a <quote>release branch</quote> of
        software.  (We discuss this pattern in
        <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.release"/>.)</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Did you notice how, in the last example, the merge
          invocation caused two distinct ranges of merges to be
          applied?  The <command>svn merge</command> command applied
          two independent patches to your working copy to
          skip over changeset 355, which your branch already
          contained.  There's nothing inherently wrong with this,
          except that it has the potential to make conflict resolution
          trickier.  If the first range of changes creates
          conflicts, you <emphasis>must</emphasis> resolve them
          interactively for the merge process to continue and
          apply the second range of changes.  If you postpone a
          conflict from the first wave of changes, the whole merge
          command will bail out with an error message.
          <footnote>
            <para>At least, this is true in Subversion 1.5 at the time
              of this writing.  This behavior may improve in future
              versions of Subversion.</para>
          </footnote>

      </warning>

      <para>A word of warning: while <command>svn diff</command> and
        <command>svn merge</command> are very similar in concept, they
        do have different syntax in many cases.  Be sure to read about
        them in <xref linkend="svn.ref"/> for details, or ask
        <command>svn help</command>.  For example, <command>svn
        merge</command> requires a working copy path as a target, that is,
        a place where it should apply the generated patch.  If the
        target isn't specified, it assumes you are trying to perform
        one of the following common operations:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You want to merge directory changes into your current
            working directory.</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If you are merging a directory and haven't specified a
        target path, <command>svn merge</command> assumes the first
        case and tries to apply the changes into your current
        directory.  If you are merging a file, and that file (or a
        file by the same name) exists in your current working
        directory,
        <command>svn merge</command> assumes the second case and tries
        to apply the changes to a local file with the same name.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.advanced.advancedsyntax">
      <title>Merge Syntax:  Full Disclosure</title>

      <para>You've now seen some examples of the <command>svn
        merge</command> command, and you're about to see several more.
        If you're feeling confused about exactly how merging works,
        you're not alone.  Many users (especially those new to version
        control) are initially perplexed about the proper syntax of
        the command and about how and when the feature should be
        used.  But fear not, this command is actually much simpler
        than you think!  There's a very easy technique for
        understanding exactly how <command>svn merge</command>
        behaves.</para>

      <para>The main source of confusion is the
        <emphasis>name</emphasis> of the command.  The term
        <quote>merge</quote> somehow denotes that branches are
        combined together, or that some sort of mysterious
        blending of data is going on.  That's not the case.  A better
        name for the command might have been <command>svn
        diff-and-apply</command>, because that's all that happens:
        two repository trees are compared, and the differences are
        applied to a working copy.</para>

      <para>If you're using <command>svn merge</command> to do basic
        copying of changes between branches, it will generally do the
        right thing automatically.  For example, a command such as the
        following:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn merge ^/branches/some-branch
</screen>

      <para>will attempt to duplicate any changes made
        on <filename>some-branch</filename> into your current working
        directory, which is presumably a working copy that shares some
        historical connection to the branch.  The command is smart
        enough to only duplicate changes that your working copy
        doesn't yet have.  If you repeat this command once a week, it
        will only duplicate the <quote>newest</quote> branch changes
        that happened since you last merged.</para>

      <para>If you choose to use the <command>svn merge</command>
        command in all its full glory by giving it specific revision
        ranges to duplicate, the command takes three main
        arguments:</para>

      <orderedlist>

        <listitem><para>An initial repository tree (often called the
        <firstterm>left side</firstterm> of the
        comparison)</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A final repository tree (often called the
        <firstterm>right side</firstterm> of the
        comparison)</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>A working copy to accept the differences as
        local changes (often called the <firstterm>target</firstterm>
        of the merge)</para></listitem>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>Once these three arguments are specified, the two trees
        are compared, and the differences are applied to the
        target working copy as local modifications.  When the command
        is done, the results are no different than if you had
        hand-edited the files or run various <command>svn
        add</command> or <command>svn delete</command> commands
        yourself.  If you like the results, you can commit them.  If
        you don't like the results, you can simply <command>svn
        revert</command> all of the changes.</para>

      <para>The syntax of <command>svn merge</command> allows you to
        specify the three necessary arguments rather flexibly.  Here
        are some examples:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn merge http://svn.example.com/repos/branch1@150 \
            http://svn.example.com/repos/branch2@212 \
            my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk my-working-copy

$ svn merge -r 100:200 http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk
</screen>

      <para>The first syntax lays out all three arguments explicitly,
        naming each tree in the form <emphasis>URL@REV</emphasis> and
        naming the working copy target.  The second syntax can be used
        as a shorthand for situations when you're comparing two
        different revisions of the same URL.  The last syntax shows
        how the working copy argument is optional; if omitted, it
        defaults to the current directory.</para>

      <para>While the first example shows the <quote>full</quote>
        syntax of <command>svn merge</command>, it needs to be used
        very carefully;  it can result in merges which do not record
        any <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> metadata at all.  The
        next section talks a bit more about this.</para>

                we discussed how to use <command>svn merge</command>

                commit r5 to the trunk, then immediately roll back r5

            <footnote>
              <para>Interestingly, after rolling back a

                since the mergeinfo would already list r5 as being

                the <option>--ignore-ancestry</option> option to make

      <title>More on Merge Conflicts</title>

      <para>Just like the <command>svn update</command> command,
        <command>svn merge</command> applies changes to your working
        copy.  And therefore it's also capable of creating
        conflicts.  The conflicts produced by <command>svn
          merge</command>, however, are sometimes different, and this
        section explains those differences.</para>

      <para>To begin with, assume that your working copy has no
        local edits.  When you <command>svn update</command> to a
        particular revision, the changes sent by the server will
        always apply <quote>cleanly</quote> to your working copy.
        The server produces the delta by comparing two trees: a
        virtual snapshot of your working copy, and the revision tree
        you're interested in.  Because the left hand side of the
        comparison is exactly equal to what you already have, the
        delta is guaranteed to correctly convert your working copy
        into the right hand tree.</para>

      <para>But <command>svn merge</command> has no such guarantees
        and can be much more chaotic: the advanced user can ask the
        server to compare <emphasis>any</emphasis> two trees at all,
        even ones that are unrelated to the working copy!  This means
        there's large potential for human error.  Users will sometimes
        compare the wrong two trees, creating a delta that doesn't
        apply cleanly.  <command>svn merge</command> will do its best
        to apply as much of the delta as possible, but some parts may
        be impossible.  Just as the Unix
        <command>patch</command> command sometimes complains about
        <quote>failed hunks,</quote> <command>svn merge</command> will
        similarly complain about <quote>skipped
        targets</quote>:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn merge -r 1288:1351 ^/branches/mybranch
U    foo.c
U    bar.c
Skipped missing target: 'baz.c'
U    glub.c
U    sputter.h

Conflict discovered in 'glorb.h'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (h) help for more options:
</screen>

      <para>In the previous example, it might be the case that
        <filename>baz.c</filename> exists in both snapshots of the
        branch being compared, and the resultant delta wants to
        change the file's contents, but the file doesn't exist in
        the working copy.  Whatever the case, the
        <quote>skipped</quote> message means that the user is most
        likely comparing the wrong two trees; it's the classic
        sign of user error.  When this happens, it's easy to
        recursively revert all the changes created by the merge
        (<userinput>svn revert . --recursive</userinput>), delete any
        unversioned files or directories left behind after the
        revert, and rerun <command>svn merge</command> with
        different arguments.</para>

      <para>Also notice that the preceding example shows a conflict
        happening on <filename>glorb.h</filename>.  We already
        stated that the working copy has no local edits: how can a
        conflict possibly happen?  Again, because the user can use
        <command>svn merge</command> to define and apply any old
        delta to the working copy, that delta may contain textual
        changes that don't cleanly apply to a working file, even if
        the file has no local modifications.</para>

      <para>Another small difference between <command>svn
          update</command> and <command>svn merge</command> is the
        names of the full-text files created when a conflict
        happens.  In <xref linkend="svn.tour.cycle.resolve"/>, we saw
        that an update produces files named
        <filename>filename.mine</filename>,
        <filename>filename.rOLDREV</filename>, and
        <filename>filename.rNEWREV</filename>.  When <command>svn
          merge</command> produces a conflict, though, it creates
        three files named <filename>filename.working</filename>,
        <filename>filename.left</filename>, and
        <filename>filename.right</filename>.  In this case, the
        terms <quote>left</quote> and <quote>right</quote> are
        describing which side of the double-tree comparison the file
        came from.  In any case, these differing names will help you
        distinguish between conflicts that happened as a result of an
        update and ones that happened as a result of a
        merge.</para>

      <title>Blocking Changes</title>

      <para>Sometimes there's a particular changeset that you don't
        want to be automatically merged.  For example, perhaps your
        team's policy is to do new development work on
        <filename>/trunk</filename>, but to be more conservative about
        backporting changes to a stable branch you use for releasing
        to the public.  On one extreme, you can manually cherrypick
        single changesets from the trunk to the branch&#x2014;just the
        changes that are stable enough to pass muster.  Maybe things
        aren't quite that strict, though; perhaps most of the time
        you'd like to just let <command>svn merge</command>
        automatically merge most changes from trunk to branch.  In
        this case, you'd like a way to mask a few specific changes
        out, that is, prevent them from ever being automatically
        merged.</para>

      <para>In Subversion 1.5, the only way to block a changeset is to
        make the system believe that the change has
        <emphasis>already</emphasis> been merged.  To do this, one can
        invoke a merge command with the <option>--record-only</option>
        option:</para>

      <screen>
$ cd my-calc-branch

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305

# Let's make the metadata list r3328 as already merged.
$ svn merge -c 3328 --record-only ^/trunk

$ svn status
M     .

$ svn propget svn:mergeinfo .
/trunk:1680-3305,3328

$ svn commit -m "Block r3328 from being merged to the branch."
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>This technique works, but it's also a little bit
        dangerous.  The main problem is that we're not clearly
        differentiating between the ideas of <quote>I already have this
        change</quote> and <quote>I don't have this change.</quote>
        We're effectively lying to the system, making it think that
        the change was previously merged.  This puts the
        responsibility on you&#x2014;the user&#x2014;to remember that
        the change wasn't actually merged, it just wasn't wanted.
        There's no way to ask Subversion for a list of <quote>blocked
        changelists.</quote> If you want to track them (so that you
        can unblock them someday). you'll need to record them in a
        text file somewhere, or perhaps in an invented property.  In
        Subversion 1.5, unfortunately, this is the only way to manage
        blocked revisions; the plans are to make a better interface
        for this in future versions.</para>

      <title>Merge-Sensitive Logs and Annotations</title>

      <para>One of the main features of any version control system is
        to keep track of who changed what, and when they did it.
        The <command>svn log</command> and <command>svn
        blame</command> commands are just the tools for this: when
        invoked on individual files, they show not only the history of
        changesets that affected the file, but also exactly which user
        wrote which line of code, and when she did it.</para>

      <para>When changes start getting replicated between branches,
        however, things start to get complicated.  For example, if you
        were to ask <command>svn log</command> about the history of
        your feature branch, it would show exactly every revision that ever
        affected the branch:</para>

      <para>And while it's true that you did actually commit those

      <title>Noticing or Ignoring Ancestry</title>

      <para>When conversing with a Subversion developer, you might
        very likely hear reference to the term
        <firstterm>ancestry</firstterm>.  This word is used to
        describe the relationship between two objects in a
        repository: if they're related to each other, one
        object is said to be an ancestor of the other.</para>

      <para>For example, suppose you commit revision 100, which
        includes a change to a file <filename>foo.c</filename>.
        Then <filename>foo.c@99</filename> is an
        <quote>ancestor</quote> of <filename>foo.c@100</filename>.
        On the other hand, suppose you commit the deletion of
        <filename>foo.c</filename> in revision 101, and then add a
        new file by the same name in revision 102.  In this case,
        <filename>foo.c@99</filename> and
        <filename>foo.c@102</filename> may appear to be related
        (they have the same path), but in fact are completely
        different objects in the repository.  They share no history
        or <quote>ancestry.</quote></para>

      <para>The reason for bringing this up is to point out an
        important difference between <command>svn diff</command> and
        <command>svn merge</command>.  The former command ignores
        ancestry, while the latter command is quite sensitive to it.
        For example, if you asked <command>svn diff</command> to
        compare revisions 99 and 102 of <filename>foo.c</filename>,
        you would see line-based diffs; the <command>diff</command>
        command is blindly comparing two paths.  But if you asked
        <command>svn merge</command> to compare the same two objects,
        it would notice that they're unrelated and first attempt to
        delete the old file, then add the new file;  the output would
        indicate a deletion followed by an add:</para>

      <screen>
D    foo.c
A    foo.c
      </screen>

      <para>Most merges involve comparing trees that are ancestrally
        related to one another; therefore, <command>svn
        merge</command> defaults to this behavior.  Occasionally,
        however, you may want the <command>merge</command> command to
        compare two unrelated trees.  For example, you may have
        imported two source-code trees representing different vendor
        releases of a software project (see
        <xref linkend="svn.advanced.vendorbr"/>).  If you ask
        <command>svn merge</command> to compare the two trees, you'd
        see the entire first tree being deleted, followed by an add
        of the entire second tree!  In these situations, you'll want
        <command>svn merge</command> to do a path-based comparison
        only, ignoring any relations between files and directories.
        Add the <option>--ignore-ancestry</option> option to your
        <command>merge</command> command, and it will behave just
          like <command>svn diff</command>.  (And conversely, the
        <option>--notice-ancestry</option> option will cause
        <command>svn diff</command> to behave like the
        <command>svn merge</command> command.)</para>

      <title>Merges and Moves</title>

      <para>A common desire is to refactor source code, especially
        in Java-based software projects.  Files and directories are
        shuffled around and renamed, often causing great disruption
        to everyone working on the project.  Sounds like a perfect
        case to use a branch, doesn't it?  Just create a branch,
        shuffle things around, and then merge the branch back to the
        trunk, right?</para>

      <para>Alas, this scenario doesn't work so well right now and
        is considered one of Subversion's current weak spots.  The
        problem is that Subversion's <command>svn update</command>
        command isn't as robust as it should be, particularly when
        dealing with copy and move operations.</para>

      <para>When you use <command>svn copy</command> to duplicate a
        file, the repository remembers where the new file came from,
        but it fails to transmit that information to the client which
        is running <command>svn update</command> or <command>svn
        merge</command>.  Instead of telling the client, <quote>Copy
        that file you already have to this new location,</quote> it
        sends down an entirely new file.  This can lead to
        problems, especially because the same thing happens with
        renamed files.  A lesser-known fact about Subversion is that
        it lacks <quote>true renames</quote>&#x2014;the <command>svn
        move</command> command is nothing more than an aggregation
        of <command>svn copy</command> and <command>svn
        delete</command>.</para>

      <para>For example, suppose that while working on your private
        branch, you rename <filename>integer.c</filename>
        to <filename>whole.c</filename>.  Effectively you've created
        a new file in your branch that is a copy of the original
        file, and deleted the original file.  Meanwhile, back
        on <filename>trunk</filename>, Sally has committed some
        improvements to <filename>integer.c</filename>.  Now you
        decide to merge your branch to the trunk:</para>

      <screen>
$ cd calc/trunk

$ svn merge --reintegrate ^/branches/my-calc-branch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
D   integer.c
A   whole.c
U   .
      </screen>

      <para>This doesn't look so bad at first glance, but it's also
        probably not what you or Sally expected.  The merge operation
        has deleted the latest version of
        the <filename>integer.c</filename> file (the one containing
        Sally's latest changes), and blindly added your
        new <filename>whole.c</filename> file&#x2014;which is a
        duplicate of the <emphasis>older</emphasis> version
        of <filename>integer.c</filename>.  The net effect is that
        merging your <quote>rename</quote> to the branch has removed
        Sally's recent changes from the latest revision!</para>

      <para>This isn't true data loss.  Sally's changes are still in
        the repository's history, but it may not be immediately
        obvious that this has happened.  The moral of this story is
        that until Subversion improves, be very careful about

      <title>Blocking Merge-Unaware Clients</title>

      <para>If you've just upgraded your server to Subversion 1.5 or
        later, there's a significant risk that pre-1.5 Subversion
        clients can mess up your automated merge tracking.  Why is
        this?  When a pre-1.5 Subversion client performs <command>svn
        merge</command>, it doesn't modify the value of
        the <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> property at all.  So the
        subsequent commit, despite being the result of a merge,
        doesn't tell the repository about the duplicated
        changes&#x2014;that information is lost.  Later on,
        when <quote>merge-aware</quote> clients attempt automatic
        merging, they're likely to run into all sorts of conflicts
        resulting from repeated merges.</para>

      <para>If you and your team are relying on the merge-tracking
        features of Subversion, you may want to configure your
        repository to prevent older clients from committing changes.
        The easy way to do this is by inspecting
        the <quote>capabilities</quote> parameter in
        the <literal>start-commit</literal> hook script.  If the
        client reports itself as having <literal>mergeinfo</literal>
        capabilities, the hook script can allow the commit to start.
        If the client doesn't report that capability, have the hook
        deny the commit.  We'll learn more about hook scripts in the
        next chapter; see
        <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.hooks"/> and
        <xref linkend="svn.ref.reposhooks.start-commit"/> for
        details.</para>

      <title>The Final Word on Merge Tracking</title>

      <para>The bottom line is that Subversion's merge-tracking
        feature has an extremely complex internal implementation, and
        the <literal>svn:mergeinfo</literal> property is the only
        window the user has into the machinery.  Because the feature
        is relatively new, a numbers of edge cases and
        possible unexpected behaviors may pop up.</para>

      <para>For example, sometimes mergeinfo will be generated when
        running a simple <command>svn copy</command> or <command>svn
        move</command> command.  Sometimes mergeinfo will appear on
        files that you didn't expect to be touched by an operation.
        Sometimes mergeinfo won't be generated at all, when you expect
        it to.  Furthermore, the management of mergeinfo metadata has
        a whole set of taxonomies and behaviors around it, such
        as <quote>explicit</quote> versus <quote>implicit</quote>
        mergeinfo, <quote>operative</quote>
        versus <quote>inoperative</quote> revisions, specific
        mechanisms of mergeinfo <quote>elision,</quote> and
        even <quote>inheritance</quote> from parent to child
        directories.</para>

      <para>We've chosen not to cover these detailed topics in this
        book for a couple of reasons.  First, the level of detail is
        absolutely overwhelming for a typical user.  Second, as
        Subversion continues to improve, we feel that a typical user
        <emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> have to understand these
        concepts; they'll eventually fade into the background as pesky
        implementation details.  All that said, if you enjoy this sort
        of thing, you can get a fantastic overview in a paper posted
        at CollabNet's website: <ulink url="http://www.collab.net/community/subversion/articles/merge-info.html"/>.</para>

    <title>Traversing Branches</title>

    <para>The <command>svn switch</command> command transforms an
      existing working copy to reflect a different branch.  While this
      command isn't strictly necessary for working with branches, it
      provides a nice shortcut.  In our earlier example,
      after creating your private branch, you checked out a fresh
      working copy of the new repository directory.  Instead, you can
      simply ask Subversion to change your working copy of
      <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> to mirror the new branch
      location:</para>

    <screen>
$ cd calc

$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

$ svn switch ^/branches/my-calc-branch
U   integer.c
U   button.c
U   Makefile
Updated to revision 341.

$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
</screen>

    <para><quote>Switching</quote> a working copy that has no local
      modifications to a different branch results in the working copy
      looking just as it would if you'd done a fresh checkout of the
      directory.  It's usually more efficient to
      use this command, because often branches differ by only a small
      degree.  The server sends only the minimal set of changes
      necessary to make your working copy reflect the branch
      directory.</para>

    <para>The <command>svn switch</command> command also takes a
      <option>--revision</option> (<option>-r</option>) option, so you
      need not always move your working copy to the
      <literal>HEAD</literal> of the branch.</para>

    <para>Of course, most projects are more complicated than our
      <filename>calc</filename> example, and contain multiple
      subdirectories.  Subversion users often follow a specific
      algorithm when using branches:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Copy the project's entire <quote>trunk</quote> to a
            new branch directory.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Switch only <emphasis>part</emphasis> of the trunk
            working copy to mirror the branch.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

    <para>In other words, if a user knows that the branch work needs
      to happen on only a specific subdirectory, she uses
      <command>svn switch</command> to move only that subdirectory to
      the branch.  (Or sometimes users will switch just a single
      working file to the branch!)  That way, the user can continue to
      receive normal <quote>trunk</quote> updates to most of her
      working copy, but the switched portions will remain immune
      (unless someone commits a change to her branch).  This feature
      adds a whole new dimension to the concept of a <quote>mixed
      working copy</quote>&#x2014;not only can working copies contain a
      mixture of working revisions, but they can also contain a
      mixture of repository locations as well.</para>

    <para>If your working copy contains a number of switched subtrees
      from different repository locations, it continues to function as
      normal.  When you update, you'll receive patches to each subtree
      as appropriate.  When you commit, your local changes will still
      be applied as a single, atomic change to the repository.</para>

    <para>Note that while it's okay for your working copy to reflect a
      mixture of repository locations, these locations must all be
      within the <emphasis>same</emphasis> repository.  Subversion
      repositories aren't yet able to communicate with one another;
      that feature is planned for the future.
      <footnote>
        <para>You <emphasis>can</emphasis>, however, use <command>svn
          switch</command> with the <option>--relocate</option> option
          if the URL of your server changes and you don't want to
          abandon an existing working copy.  See <xref linkend="svn.ref.svn.c.switch"/> for more information and an
          example.</para>
      </footnote>
    </para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Switches and Updates</title>

      <para>Have you noticed that the output of <command>svn
        switch</command> and <command>svn update</command> looks the
        same?  The switch command is actually a superset of the update
        command.</para>

      <para>When you run <command>svn update</command>, you're asking
        the repository to compare two trees.  The repository does so,
        and then sends a description of the differences back to the
        client.  The only difference between <command>svn
        switch</command> and <command>svn update</command> is that the
        latter command always compares two identical repository
        paths.</para>

      <para>That is, if your working copy is a mirror of
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>, <command>svn
        update</command> will automatically compare your working copy
        of <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> to
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> in the
        <literal>HEAD</literal> revision.  If you're switching your
        working copy to a branch, <command>svn switch</command>
        will compare your working copy of
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> to some
        <emphasis>other</emphasis> branch directory in the
        <literal>HEAD</literal> revision.</para>

      <para>In other words, an update moves your working copy through
        time.  A switch moves your working copy through time
        <emphasis>and</emphasis> space.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Because <command>svn switch</command> is essentially a
      variant of <command>svn update</command>, it shares the same
      behaviors; any local modifications in your working copy are
      preserved when new data arrives from the repository.</para>


      <tip>
        <para>Have you ever found yourself making some complex edits
          (in your <filename>/trunk</filename> working copy) and
          suddenly realized, <quote>Hey, these changes ought to be in
          their own branch?</quote>  A great technique to do this can
          be summarized in two steps:</para>

          <screen>
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/newbranch \
      -m "Create branch 'newbranch'."
Committed revision 353.
$ svn switch ^/branches/newbranch
At revision 353.
</screen>

        <para>The <command>svn switch</command> command, like
          <command>svn update</command>, preserves your local edits.
          At this point, your working copy is now a reflection of the
          newly created branch, and your next <command>svn
          commit</command> invocation will send your changes
          there.</para> </tip>

  <sect1 id="svn.branchmerge.tags">
    <title>Tags</title>

    <para>Another common version control concept is a
      <firstterm>tag</firstterm>.  A tag is just a
      <quote>snapshot</quote> of a project in time.  In Subversion,
      this idea already seems to be everywhere.  Each repository
      revision is exactly that&#x2014;a snapshot of the filesystem
      after each commit.</para>

    <para>However, people often want to give more human-friendly names
      to tags, such as <literal>release-1.0</literal>.  And they want
      to make snapshots of smaller subdirectories of the filesystem.
      After all, it's not so easy to remember that release 1.0 of a
      piece of software is a particular subdirectory of revision
      4822.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.tags.mksimple">
      <title>Creating a Simple Tag</title>

      <para>Once again, <command>svn copy</command> comes to the
        rescue.  If you want to create a snapshot of
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> exactly as it looks in the
        <literal>HEAD</literal> revision, make a copy of it:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/release-1.0 \
      -m "Tagging the 1.0 release of the 'calc' project."

Committed revision 902.
</screen>

      <para>This example assumes that a
        <filename>/calc/tags</filename> directory already exists.  (If
        it doesn't, you can create it using <command>svn
        mkdir</command>.)  After the copy completes, the new
        <filename>release-1.0</filename> directory is forever a
        snapshot of how the <filename>/trunk</filename> directory
        looked in the <literal>HEAD</literal> revision at the time you
        made the copy.  Of course, you might want to be more precise
        about exactly which revision you copy, in case somebody else
        may have committed changes to the project when you weren't
        looking.  So if you know that revision 901 of
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename> is exactly the snapshot you
        want, you can specify it by passing <option>-r 901</option> to
        the <command>svn copy</command> command.</para>

      <para>But wait a moment: isn't this tag creation procedure the
        same procedure we used to create a branch?  Yes, in fact, it
        is.  In Subversion, there's no difference between a tag and a
        branch.  Both are just ordinary directories that are created
        by copying.  Just as with branches, the only reason a copied
        directory is a <quote>tag</quote> is because
        <emphasis>humans</emphasis> have decided to treat it that way:
        as long as nobody ever commits to the directory, it forever
        remains a snapshot.  If people start committing to it, it
        becomes a branch.</para>

      <para>If you are administering a repository, there are two
        approaches you can take to managing tags.  The first approach
        is <quote>hands off</quote>: as a matter of project policy,
        decide where your tags will live, and make sure all users know
        how to treat the directories they copy.  (That is, make sure
        they know not to commit to them.)  The second approach is more
        paranoid: you can use one of the access control scripts
        provided with Subversion to prevent anyone from doing anything
        but creating new copies in the tags area (see
        <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/>).  The paranoid approach,
        however, isn't usually necessary.  If a user accidentally
        commits a change to a tag directory, you can simply undo the
        change as discussed in the previous section.  This is version
        control, after all!</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.tags.mkcomplex">
      <title>Creating a Complex Tag</title>

      <para>Sometimes you may want your <quote>snapshot</quote> to be
        more complicated than a single directory at a single
        revision.</para>

      <para>For example, pretend your project is much larger than our
        <filename>calc</filename> example: suppose it contains a
        number of subdirectories and many more files.  In the course
        of your work, you may decide that you need to create a working
        copy that is designed to have specific features and bug fixes.
        You can accomplish this by selectively backdating files or
        directories to particular revisions (using <command>svn update</command>
        with the <option>-r</option> option liberally), by switching files and directories to
        particular branches (making use of <command>svn
        switch</command>), or even just by making a bunch of local
        changes.  When you're done, your working copy is a hodgepodge
        of repository locations from different revisions.  But after
        testing, you know it's the precise combination of data you
        need to tag.</para>

      <para>Time to make a snapshot.  Copying one URL to another won't
        work here.  In this case, you want to make a snapshot of your
        exact working copy arrangement and store it in the repository.
        Luckily, <command>svn copy</command> actually has four
        different uses (which you can read about in <xref linkend="svn.ref"/>), including the ability to copy a
        working copy tree to the repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ ls
my-working-copy/

$ svn copy my-working-copy \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/tags/mytag \
           -m "Tag my existing working copy state."

Committed revision 940.
</screen>

      <para>Now there is a new directory in the repository,
        <filename>/calc/tags/mytag</filename>, which is an exact
        snapshot of your working copy&#x2014;mixed revisions, URLs,
        local changes, and all.</para>

      <para>Other users have found interesting uses for this feature.
        Sometimes there are situations where you have a bunch of local
        changes made to your working copy, and you'd like a
        collaborator to see them.  Instead of running <command>svn
        diff</command> and sending a patch file (which won't capture
        directory, symlink, or property changes), you can
        use <command>svn copy</command> to <quote>upload</quote> your
        working copy to a private area of the repository.  Your
        collaborator can then either check out a verbatim copy of your
        working copy or use <command>svn merge</command> to receive
        your exact changes.</para>

      <para>While this is a nice method for uploading a quick snapshot
        of your working copy, note that this is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        a good way to initially create a branch.  Branch creation should
        be an event unto itself, and this method conflates the creation
        of a branch with extra changes to files, all within a single revision.
        This makes it very difficult (later on) to identify a single
        revision number as a branch point.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.branchmerge.maint">
    <title>Branch Maintenance</title>

    <para>You may have noticed by now that Subversion is extremely
      flexible.  Because it implements branches and tags with the same
      underlying mechanism (directory copies), and because branches
      and tags appear in normal filesystem space, many people find
      Subversion intimidating.  It's almost <emphasis>too</emphasis>
      flexible.  In this section, we'll offer some suggestions for
      arranging and managing your data over time.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.maint.layout">
      <title>Repository Layout</title>

      <para>There are some standard, recommended ways to organize a
        repository.  Most people create a <filename>trunk</filename>
        directory to hold the <quote>main line</quote> of development,
        a <filename>branches</filename> directory to contain branch
        copies, and a <filename>tags</filename> directory to contain
        tag copies.  If a repository holds only one project,
        often people create these top-level directories:</para>

      <screen>
/trunk
/branches
/tags
</screen>

      <para>If a repository contains multiple projects, admins
        typically index their layout by project (see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"/> to read more about
        <quote>project roots</quote>):</para>

      <screen>
/paint/trunk
/paint/branches
/paint/tags
/calc/trunk
/calc/branches
/calc/tags
</screen>

      <para>Of course, you're free to ignore these common layouts.
        You can create any sort of variation, whatever works best for
        you or your team.  Remember that whatever you choose, it's not
        a permanent commitment.  You can reorganize your repository at
        any time.  Because branches and tags are ordinary directories,
        the <command>svn move</command> command can move or rename
        them however you wish.  Switching from one layout to another
        is just a matter of issuing a series of server-side moves; if
        you don't like the way things are organized in the repository,
        just juggle the directories around.</para>

      <para>Remember, though, that while moving directories may be
        easy to do, you need to be considerate of your users as well.
        Your juggling can be disorienting to users with existing
        working copies.  If a user has a working copy of a particular
        repository directory, your <command>svn move</command>
        operation might remove the path from the latest revision.
        When the user next runs <command>svn update</command>, she will
        be told that her working copy represents a path that no
        longer exists, and the user will be forced to <command>svn
        switch</command> to the new location.

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.maint.lifetime">
      <title>Data Lifetimes</title>

      <para>Another nice feature of Subversion's model is that
        branches and tags can have finite lifetimes, just like any
        other versioned item.  For example, suppose you eventually
        finish all your work on your personal branch of the
        <filename>calc</filename> project.  After merging all of your
        changes back into <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>, there's
        no need for your private branch directory to stick around
        anymore:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
             -m "Removing obsolete branch of calc project."

Committed revision 375.
</screen>

      <para>And now your branch is gone.  Of course, it's not really
        gone: the directory is simply missing from the
        <literal>HEAD</literal> revision, no longer distracting
        anyone.  If you use <command>svn checkout</command>,
        <command>svn switch</command>, or <command>svn list</command>
        to examine an earlier revision, you'll still be able to see
        your old branch.</para>

      <para>If browsing your deleted directory isn't enough, you can
        always bring it back.  Resurrecting data is very easy in
        Subversion.  If there's a deleted directory (or file) that
        you'd like to bring back into <literal>HEAD</literal>, simply
        use <command>svn copy</command> to copy it from the old
        revision:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch@374 \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
           -m "Restore my-calc-branch."

Committed revision 376.
</screen>

      <para>In our example, your personal branch had a relatively
        short lifetime: you may have created it to fix a bug or
        implement a new feature.  When your task is done, so is the
        branch.  In software development, though, it's also common to
        have two <quote>main</quote> branches running side by side for
        very long periods.  For example, suppose it's time to release
        a stable version of the <filename>calc</filename> project to the
        public, and you know it's going to take a couple of months to
        shake bugs out of the software.  You don't want people to add
        new features to the project, but you don't want to tell all
        developers to stop programming either.  So instead, you create
        a <quote>stable</quote> branch of the software that won't
        change much:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/stable-1.0 \
           -m "Creating stable branch of calc project."

Committed revision 377.
</screen>

      <para>And now developers are free to continue adding
        cutting-edge (or experimental) features to
        <filename>/calc/trunk</filename>, and you can declare a
        project policy that only bug fixes are to be committed to
        <filename>/calc/branches/stable-1.0</filename>.  That is, as
        people continue to work on the trunk, a human selectively
        ports bug fixes over to the stable branch.  Even after the
        stable branch has shipped, you'll probably continue to
        maintain the branch for a long time&#x2014;that is, as long
        as you continue to support that release for customers.  We'll
        discuss this more in the next section.</para>

    <title>Common Branching Patterns</title>

    <para>There are many different uses for branching and <command>svn
        merge</command>, and this section describes the most
        common.</para>

    <para>Version control is most often used for software
      development, so here's a quick peek at two of the most common
      branching/merging patterns used by teams of programmers.  If
      you're not using Subversion for software development, feel
      free to skip this section.  If you're a software developer
      using version control for the first time, pay close attention,
      as these patterns are often considered best practices by
      experienced folk.  These processes aren't specific to
      Subversion; they're applicable to any version control system.
      Still, it may help to see them described in Subversion
      terms.</para>

      <title>Release Branches</title>

      <para>Most software has a typical life cycle: code, test,
        release, repeat.  There are two problems with this process.
        First, developers need to keep writing new features while
        quality assurance teams take time to test supposedly stable
        versions of the software.  New work cannot halt while the
        software is tested.  Second, the team almost always needs to
        support older, released versions of software; if a bug is
        discovered in the latest code, it most likely exists in
        released versions as well, and customers will want to get
        that bug fix without having to wait for a major new
        release.</para>

      <para>Here's where version control can help.  The typical
        procedure looks like this:</para>

      <orderedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Developers commit all new work to the
              trunk.</emphasis>

            Day-to-day changes are committed to
            <filename>/trunk</filename>: new features, bug fixes, and
            so on.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>The trunk is copied to a
              <quote>release</quote> branch.</emphasis>

            When the team thinks the software is ready for release
            (say, a 1.0 release), <filename>/trunk</filename>
            might be copied to
            <filename>/branches/1.0</filename>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Teams continue to work in parallel.</emphasis>

            One team begins rigorous testing of the release branch,
            while another team continues new work (say, for version
            2.0) on <filename>/trunk</filename>.  If bugs are
            discovered in either location, fixes are ported back and
            forth as necessary.  At some point, however, even that
            process stops.  The branch is <quote>frozen</quote> for
            final testing right before a release.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>The branch is tagged and released.</emphasis>

            When testing is complete,
            <filename>/branches/1.0</filename> is copied to
            <filename>/tags/1.0.0</filename> as a reference
            snapshot.  The tag is packaged and released to
            customers.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>The branch is maintained over time.</emphasis>

            While work continues on <filename>/trunk</filename> for
            version 2.0, bug fixes continue to be ported from
            <filename>/trunk</filename> to
            <filename>/branches/1.0</filename>.  When enough
            bug fixes have accumulated, management may decide to do a
            1.0.1 release: <filename>/branches/1.0</filename> is
            copied to <filename>/tags/1.0.1</filename>, and the tag
            is packaged and released.</para>
        </listitem>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>This entire process repeats as the software matures:
        when the 2.0 work is complete, a new 2.0 release branch is
        created, tested, tagged, and eventually released.  After
        some years, the repository ends up with a number of release
        branches in <quote>maintenance</quote> mode, and a number
        of tags representing final shipped versions.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.branchmerge.commonpatterns.feature">
      <title>Feature Branches</title>

      <para>A <firstterm>feature branch</firstterm> is the sort of
        branch that's been the dominant example in this chapter (the
        one you've been working on while Sally continues to work on
        <filename>/trunk</filename>).  It's a temporary branch created
        to work on a complex change without interfering with the
        stability of <filename>/trunk</filename>.  Unlike release
        branches (which may need to be supported forever), feature
        branches are born, used for a while, merged back to the trunk,
        and then ultimately deleted.  They have a finite span of
        usefulness.</para>

      <para>Again, project policies vary widely concerning exactly
        when it's appropriate to create a feature branch.  Some
        projects never use feature branches at all: commits to
        <filename>/trunk</filename> are a free-for-all.  The
        advantage to this system is that it's simple&#x2014;nobody
        needs to learn about branching or merging.  The disadvantage
        is that the trunk code is often unstable or unusable.  Other
        projects use branches to an extreme: no change is
        <emphasis>ever</emphasis> committed to the trunk directly.
        Even the most trivial changes are created on a short-lived
        branch, carefully reviewed, and merged to the trunk.  Then
        the branch is deleted.  This system guarantees an
        exceptionally stable and usable trunk at all times, but at
        the cost of tremendous process overhead.</para>

      <para>Most projects take a middle-of-the-road approach.  They
        commonly insist that <filename>/trunk</filename> compile and
        pass regression tests at all times.  A feature branch is
        required only when a change requires a large number of
        destabilizing commits.  A good rule of thumb is to ask this
        question: if the developer worked for days in isolation and
        then committed the large change all at once (so that
        <filename>/trunk</filename> were never destabilized), would it
        be too large a change to review?  If the answer to that
        question is <quote>yes,</quote> the change should be
        developed on a feature branch.  As the developer commits
        incremental changes to the branch, they can be easily reviewed
        by peers.</para>

      <para>Finally, there's the issue of how to best keep a feature
        branch in <quote>sync</quote> with the trunk as work
        progresses.  As we mentioned earlier, there's a great risk to
        working on a branch for weeks or months; trunk changes may
        continue to pour in, to the point where the two lines of
        development differ so greatly that it may become a nightmare
        trying to merge the branch back to the trunk.</para>

      <para>This situation is best avoided by regularly merging trunk
        changes to the branch.  Make up a policy: once a week, merge
        the last week's worth of trunk changes to the branch.</para>

      <para>At some point, you'll be ready to merge the
        <quote>synchronized</quote> feature branch back to the trunk.
        To do this, begin by doing a final merge of the latest trunk
        changes to the branch.  When that's done, the latest versions
        of branch and trunk will be absolutely identical except for
        your branch changes.  You would then merge back with
        the <option>--reintegrate</option> option:</para>

      <screen>
$ cd trunk-working-copy

$ svn update
At revision 1910.

$ svn merge --reintegrate ^/branches/mybranch
--- Merging differences between repository URLs into '.':
U    real.c
U    integer.c
A    newdirectory
A    newdirectory/newfile
 U   .
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>Another way of thinking about this pattern is that your
        weekly sync of trunk to branch is analogous to running
        <command>svn update</command> in a working copy, while the
        final merge step is analogous to running <command>svn
          commit</command> from a working copy.  After all, what else
        <emphasis>is</emphasis> a working copy but a very shallow
        private branch?  It's a branch that's capable of
        storing only one change at a time.</para>

    <title>Vendor Branches</title>

    <para>As is especially the case when developing software, the data
      that you maintain under version control is often closely related
      to, or perhaps dependent upon, someone else's data.  Generally,
      the needs of your project will dictate that you stay as
      up to date as possible with the data provided by that external
      entity without sacrificing the stability of your own project.
      This scenario plays itself out all the time&#x2014;anywhere that
      the information generated by one group of people has a direct
      effect on that which is generated by another group.</para>

    <para>For example, software developers might be working on an
      application that makes use of a third-party library.  Subversion
      has just such a relationship with the Apache Portable Runtime (APR)
      library (see <xref linkend="svn.developer.usingapi.apr"/>).
      The Subversion source code depends on the APR library for all
      its portability needs.  In earlier stages of Subversion's
      development, the project closely tracked APR's changing API,
      always sticking to the <quote>bleeding edge</quote> of the
      library's code churn.  Now that both APR and Subversion have
      matured, Subversion attempts to synchronize with APR's library
      API only at well-tested, stable release points.</para>

    <para>Now, if your project depends on someone else's information,
      you could attempt to synchronize that information with your own
      in several ways.  Most painfully, you could issue oral or
      written instructions to all the contributors of your project,
      telling them to make sure they have the specific versions
      of that third-party information that your project needs.  If the
      third-party information is maintained in a Subversion
      repository, you could also use Subversion's externals
      definitions to effectively <quote>pin down</quote> specific
      versions of that information to some location in your own
      working copy directory (see
      <xref linkend="svn.advanced.externals"/>).</para>

    <para>But sometimes you want to maintain custom modifications to
      third-party code in your own version control system.  Returning
      to the software development example, programmers might need to
      make modifications to that third-party library for their own
      purposes.  These modifications might include new functionality
      or bug fixes, maintained internally only until they become part
      of an official release of the third-party library.  Or the
      changes might never be relayed back to the library maintainers,
      existing solely as custom tweaks to make the library further
      suit the needs of the software developers.</para>

    <para>Now you face an interesting situation.  Your project could
      house its custom modifications to the third-party data in some
      disjointed fashion, such as using patch files or full-fledged
      alternative versions of files and directories.  But these quickly
      become maintenance headaches, requiring some mechanism by which
      to apply your custom changes to the third-party code and
      necessitating regeneration of those changes with each successive
      version of the third-party code that you track.</para>

    <para>The solution to this problem is to use <firstterm>vendor
      branches</firstterm>.  A vendor branch is a directory tree in
      your own version control system that contains information
      provided by a third-party entity, or vendor.  Each version of
      the vendor's data that you decide to absorb into your project is
      called a <firstterm>vendor drop</firstterm>.</para> 

    <para>Vendor branches provide two benefits.  First, by storing
      the currently supported vendor drop in your own version control
      system, you ensure that the members of your project never need to question
      whether they have the right version of the vendor's data.  They
      simply receive that correct version as part of their regular
      working copy updates.  Second, because the data lives in your
      own Subversion repository, you can store your custom changes to
      it in-place&#x2014;you have no more need of an automated (or
      worse, manual) method for swapping in your customizations.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.vendorbr.general">
      <title>General Vendor Branch Management Procedure</title>

      <para>Managing vendor branches generally works like this: first,
        you create a top-level directory (such as
        <filename>/vendor</filename>) to hold the vendor branches.
        Then you import the third-party code into a subdirectory of
        that top-level directory.  You then copy that subdirectory
        into your main development branch (e.g.,
        <filename>/trunk</filename>) at the appropriate location.  You
        always make your local changes in the main development branch.
        With each new release of the code you are tracking, you bring
        it into the vendor branch and merge the changes into
        <filename>/trunk</filename>, resolving whatever conflicts
        occur between your local changes and the upstream
        changes.</para>

      <para>An example will help to clarify this algorithm.  We'll use
        a scenario where your development team is creating a
        calculator program that links against a third-party complex
        number arithmetic library, libcomplex.  We'll begin with the
        initial creation of the vendor branch and the import of the
        first vendor drop.  We'll call our vendor branch directory
        <filename>libcomplex</filename>, and our code drops will go
        into a subdirectory of our vendor branch called
        <filename>current</filename>.  And since <command>svn
        import</command> creates all the intermediate parent
        directories it needs, we can actually accomplish both of these
        steps with a single command:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn import /path/to/libcomplex-1.0 \
             http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current \
             -m 'importing initial 1.0 vendor drop'
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>We now have the current version of the libcomplex source
        code in <filename>/vendor/libcomplex/current</filename>.  Now,
        we tag that version (see <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.tags"/>)
        and then copy it into the main development branch.  Our copy
        will create a new directory called
        <filename>libcomplex</filename> in our existing
        <filename>calc</filename> project directory.  It is in this
        copied version of the vendor data that we will make our
        customizations:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/current  \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
           -m 'tagging libcomplex-1.0'
&#x2026;
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex/1.0  \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/libcomplex        \
           -m 'bringing libcomplex-1.0 into the main branch'
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>We check out our project's main branch&#x2014;which now
        includes a copy of the first vendor drop&#x2014;and we get to
        work customizing the libcomplex code.  Before we know it, our
        modified version of libcomplex is now completely integrated
        into our calculator program.
        <footnote>
          <para>And is entirely bug-free, of course!</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>A few weeks later, the developers of libcomplex release a
        new version of their library&#x2014;version 1.1&#x2014;which
        contains some features and functionality that we really want.
        We'd like to upgrade to this new version, but without losing
        the customizations we made to the existing version.  What we
        essentially would like to do is to replace our current
        baseline version of libcomplex 1.0 with a copy of libcomplex
        1.1, and then re-apply the custom modifications we previously
        made to that library to the new version.  But we actually
        approach the problem from the other direction, applying the
        changes made to libcomplex between versions 1.0 and 1.1 to our
        modified copy of it.</para>

      <para>To perform this upgrade, we check out a copy of our vendor
        branch and replace the code in the
        <filename>current</filename> directory with the new libcomplex
        1.1 source code.  We quite literally copy new files on top of
        existing files, perhaps exploding the libcomplex 1.1 release
        tarball atop our existing files and directories.  The goal
        here is to make our <filename>current</filename> directory
        contain only the libcomplex 1.1 code and to ensure that all
        that code is under version control.  Oh, and we want to do
        this with as little version control history disturbance as
        possible.</para>

      <para>After replacing the 1.0 code with 1.1 code, <command>svn
        status</command> will show files with local modifications as
        well as, perhaps, some unversioned files.  If we did what we
        were supposed to do, the unversioned files are only those new
        files introduced in the 1.1 release of libcomplex&#x2014;we
        run <command>svn add</command> on those to get them under
        version control.  If the 1.1 code no longer has certain files
        that were in the 1.0 tree, it may be hard to notice them;
        you'd have to compare the two trees with some external tool
        and then <command>svn delete</command> any files present in
        1.0 but not in 1.1.  (Although it might also be just fine to
        let these same files live on in unused obscurity!)  Finally,
        once our <filename>current</filename> working copy contains
        only the libcomplex 1.1 code, we commit the changes we made to
        get it looking that way.</para>

      <para>Our <filename>current</filename> branch now contains the
        new vendor drop.  We tag the new version as 1.1 (in the same
        way we previously tagged the version 1.0 vendor drop), and
        then merge the differences between the tag of the previous
        version and the new current version into our main development
        branch:</para>

      <screen>
$ cd working-copies/calc
$ svn merge ^/vendor/libcomplex/1.0      \
            ^/vendor/libcomplex/current  \

      <para>In the trivial use case, the new version of our
        third-party tool would look, from a files-and-directories
        point of view, just like the previous version.  None of the
        libcomplex source files would have been deleted, renamed, or
        moved to different locations&#x2014;the new version would
        contain only textual modifications against the previous one.
        In a perfect world, our modifications would apply cleanly to
        the new version of the library, with absolutely no
        complications or conflicts.</para>

      <para>But things aren't always that simple, and in fact it is
        quite common for source files to get moved around between
        releases of software.  This complicates the process of
        ensuring that our modifications are still valid for the new
        version of code, and things can quickly degrade into a
        situation where we have to manually re-create our
        customizations in the new version.  Once Subversion knows
        about the history of a given source file&#x2014;including all
        its previous locations&#x2014;the process of merging in the new
        version of the library is pretty simple.  But we are
        responsible for telling Subversion how the source file layout
        changed from vendor drop to vendor drop.</para>

      <para>Vendor drops that contain more than a few deletes,
        additions, and moves complicate the process of upgrading to
        each successive version of the third-party data.  So
        Subversion supplies the <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command>
        script to assist with this process.  This script automates the
        importing steps we mentioned in the general vendor branch
        management procedure to make sure mistakes are minimized.
        You will still be responsible for using the merge commands to
        merge the new versions of the third-party data into your main
        development branch, but <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command>
        can help you more quickly and easily arrive at that
        stage.</para>

      <para>In short, <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> is an
        enhancement to <command>svn import</command> that has several
        important characteristics:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>It can be run at any point in time to bring an existing
            directory in the repository to exactly match an external
            directory, performing all the necessary adds and deletes,
            and optionally performing moves, too.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>It takes care of complicated series of operations between
            which Subversion requires an intermediate commit&#x2014;such
            as before renaming a file or directory twice.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>It will optionally tag the newly imported directory.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>It will optionally add arbitrary properties to files and
            directories that match a regular expression.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> takes three mandatory
        arguments.  The first argument is the URL to the base
        Subversion directory to work in.  This argument is followed by
        the URL&#x2014;relative to the first argument&#x2014;into which the
        current vendor drop will be imported.  Finally, the third
        argument is the local directory to import.  Using our previous
        example, a typical run of <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command>
        might look like this:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn_load_dirs.pl http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                        \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>You can indicate that you'd like
        <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> to tag the new vendor drop
        by passing the <option>-t</option> command-line option and
        specifying a tag name.  This tag is another URL relative to
        the first program argument.</para>

      <screen>
$ svn_load_dirs.pl -t libcomplex-1.1                              \
                   http://svn.example.com/repos/vendor/libcomplex \
                   current                                        \
                   /path/to/libcomplex-1.1
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>When you run <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command>, it
        examines the contents of your existing <quote>current</quote>
        vendor drop and compares them with the proposed new vendor
        drop.  In the trivial case, no files will be in
        one version and not the other, and the script will perform the
        new import without incident.  If, however, there are
        discrepancies in the file layouts between versions,
        <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> will ask you how
        to resolve those differences.  For example, you
        will have the opportunity to tell the script that you know
        that the file <filename>math.c</filename> in version 1.0 of
        libcomplex was renamed to <filename>arithmetic.c</filename> in
        libcomplex 1.1.  Any discrepancies not explained by moves
        are treated as regular additions and deletions.</para>

      <para>The script also accepts a separate configuration file for
        setting properties on files and directories matching a regular
        expression that are <emphasis>added</emphasis> to the
        repository.  This configuration file is specified to
        <command>svn_load_dirs.pl</command> using the
        <option>-p</option> command-line option.  Each line of the
        configuration file is a whitespace-delimited set of two or
        four values: a Perl-style regular expression against which to match the
        added path, a control keyword (either
        <literal>break</literal> or <literal>cont</literal>), and then
        optionally a property name and value.</para>

      <screen>
\.png$              break   svn:mime-type   image/png
\.jpe?g$            break   svn:mime-type   image/jpeg
\.m3u$              cont    svn:mime-type   audio/x-mpegurl
\.m3u$              break   svn:eol-style   LF
.*                  break   svn:eol-style   native
</screen>

      <para>For each added path, the configured property changes whose
        regular expression matches the path are applied in order,
        unless the control specification is <literal>break</literal>
        (which means that no more property changes should be applied
        to that path).  If the control specification is
        <literal>cont</literal>&#x2014;an abbreviation for
        <literal>continue</literal>&#x2014;matching will continue
        with the next line of the configuration file.</para>

      <para>Any whitespace in the regular expression, property name,
        or property value must be surrounded by either single or
        double quotes.  You can escape quotes that
        are not used for wrapping whitespace by preceding them with a
        backslash (<literal>\</literal>) character.  The backslash
        escapes only quotes when parsing the configuration file, so do
        not protect any other characters beyond what is necessary for
        the regular expression.</para>

    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>We covered a lot of ground in this chapter.  We
      discussed the concepts of tags and branches and demonstrated
      how Subversion implements these concepts by copying directories
      with the <command>svn copy</command> command.  We showed how
      to use <command>svn merge</command> to copy changes from one
      branch to another or roll back bad changes.  We went over
      the use of <command>svn switch</command> to create
      mixed-location working copies.  And we talked about how one
      might manage the organization and lifetimes of branches in a
      repository.</para>

    <para>Remember the Subversion mantra: branches and tags are cheap.
      So don't be afraid to use them when needed!</para>

  <title>Repository Administration</title>

  <para>The Subversion repository is the central storehouse of all
    your versioned data.  As such, it becomes an obvious candidate for
    all the love and attention an administrator can offer.  While the
    repository is generally a low-maintenance item, it is important to
    understand how to properly configure and care for it so that
    potential problems are avoided, and so actual problems are safely
    resolved.</para>

  <para>In this chapter, we'll discuss how to create and configure a
    Subversion repository.  We'll also talk about repository
    maintenance, providing examples of how and when to use the
    <command>svnlook</command> and <command>svnadmin</command> tools
    provided with Subversion.  We'll address some common questions and
    mistakes and give some suggestions on how to arrange the data in
    the repository.</para>

  <para>If you plan to access a Subversion repository only in the
    role of a user whose data is under version control (i.e., via
    a Subversion client), you can skip this chapter altogether.
    However, if you are, or wish to become, a Subversion repository
    administrator,
    <footnote>
      <para>This may sound really prestigious and lofty, but we're
        just talking about anyone who is interested in that
        mysterious realm beyond the working copy where everyone's
        data hangs out.</para>
    </footnote>
    this chapter is for you.</para>

    <title>The Subversion Repository, Defined</title>

    <para>Before jumping into the broader topic of repository
      administration, let's further define what a repository is.  How
      does it look?  How does it feel?  Does it take its tea hot or
      iced, sweetened, and with lemon?  As an administrator, you'll be
      expected to understand the composition of a repository both from
      a literal, OS-level perspective&#x2014;how a repository looks and
      acts with respect to non-Subversion tools&#x2014;and from a
      logical perspective&#x2014;dealing with how data is represented
      <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the repository.</para>

    <para>Seen through the eyes of a typical file browser application
      (such as Windows Explorer) or command-line based filesystem
      navigation tools, the Subversion repository is just another
      directory full of stuff.  There are some subdirectories with
      human-readable configuration files in them, some subdirectories
      with some not-so-human-readable data files, and so on.  As in
      other areas of the Subversion design, modularity is given high
      regard, and hierarchical organization is preferred to cluttered
      chaos.  So a shallow glance into a typical repository from a
      nuts-and-bolts perspective is sufficient to reveal the basic
      components of the repository:</para>
            
    <screen>
$ ls repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt

    <para>Here's a quick fly-by overview of what exactly you're seeing
      in this directory listing.  (Don't get bogged down in the

      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>Of course, when accessed via the Subversion libraries, this
      otherwise unremarkable collection of files and directories
      suddenly becomes an implementation of a virtual, versioned
      filesystem, complete with customizable event triggers.  This
      filesystem has its own notions of directories and files, very
      similar to the notions of such things held by real filesystems
      (such as NTFS, FAT32, ext3, etc.).  But this is a special
      filesystem&#x2014;it hangs these directories and files from
      revisions, keeping all the changes you've ever made to them
      safely stored and forever accessible.  This is where the
      entirety of your versioned data lives.</para>

    <title>Strategies for Repository Deployment</title>

    <para>Due largely to the simplicity of the overall design of the
      Subversion repository and the technologies on which it relies,
      creating and configuring a repository are fairly straightforward
      tasks.  There are a few preliminary decisions you'll want to
      make, but the actual work involved in any given setup of a
      Subversion repository is pretty basic, tending toward
      mindless repetition if you find yourself setting up multiples of
      these things.</para>

    <para>Some things you'll want to consider beforehand, though, are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>What data do you expect to live in your repository (or
          repositories), and how will that data be organized?</para>

          to use?</para>

    <para>In this section, we'll try to help you answer those
      questions.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout">
      <title>Planning Your Repository Organization</title>

      <para>While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files
        and directories without any loss of information, and even
        provides ways of moving whole sets of versioned history from
        one repository to another, doing so can greatly disrupt the
        workflow of those who access the repository often and come to
        expect things to be at certain locations.  So before creating
        a new repository, try to peer into the future a bit; plan
        ahead before placing your data under version control.  By
        conscientiously <quote>laying out</quote> your repository or
        repositories and their versioned contents ahead of time, you
        can prevent many future headaches.</para>

      <para>Let's assume that as repository administrator, you will be
        responsible for supporting the version control system for
        several projects.  Your first decision is whether to use a
        single repository for multiple projects, or to give each
        project its own repository, or some compromise of these
        two.</para>

      <para>There are benefits to using a single repository for
        multiple projects, most obviously the lack of duplicated
        maintenance.  A single repository means that there is one set
        of hook programs, one thing to routinely back up, one thing to
        dump and load if Subversion releases an incompatible new
        version, and so on.  Also, you can move data between projects
        easily, without losing any historical versioning
        information.</para>

      <para>The downside of using a single repository is that
        different projects may have different requirements in terms of
        the repository event triggers, such as needing to send commit
        notification emails to different mailing lists, or having
        different definitions about what does and does not constitute
        a legitimate commit.  These aren't insurmountable problems, of
        course&#x2014;it just means that all of your hook scripts have
        to be sensitive to the layout of your repository rather than
        assuming that the whole repository is associated with a single
        group of people.  Also, remember that Subversion uses
        repository-global revision numbers.  While those numbers don't
        have any particular magical powers, some folks still don't
        like the fact that even though no changes have been made to
        their project lately, the youngest revision number for the
        repository keeps climbing because other projects are actively
        adding new revisions.
        <footnote>
          <para>Whether founded in ignorance or in poorly considered
            concepts about how to derive legitimate software
            development metrics, global revision numbers are a silly
            thing to fear, and <emphasis>not</emphasis> the kind of
            thing you should weigh when deciding how to arrange your
            projects and repositories.</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>A middle-ground approach can be taken, too.  For example,
        projects can be grouped by how well they relate to each other.
        You might have a few repositories with a handful of projects
        in each repository.  That way, projects that are likely to
        want to share data can do so easily, and as new revisions are
        added to the repository, at least the developers know that
        those new revisions are at least remotely related to everyone
        who uses that repository.</para>

      <para>After deciding how to organize your projects with respect
        to repositories, you'll probably want to think about directory
        hierarchies within the repositories themselves.  Because
        Subversion uses regular directory copies for branching and
        tagging (see <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>), the
        Subversion community recommends that you choose a repository
        location for each <firstterm>project
        root</firstterm>&#x2014;the <quote>topmost</quote> directory
        that contains data related to that project&#x2014;and then
        create three subdirectories beneath that root:
        <filename>trunk</filename>, meaning the directory under which
        the main project development occurs;
        <filename>branches</filename>, which is a directory in which
        to create various named branches of the main development line;
        and <filename>tags</filename>, which is a collection of tree
        snapshots that are created, and perhaps destroyed, but never
        changed.
        <footnote>
          <para>The <filename>trunk</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>, 
            and <filename>branches</filename> trio is sometimes referred
            to as <quote>the TTB directories.</quote></para>
        </footnote>
        </para>

      <para>For example, your repository might look like this:</para>

      <screen>
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   &#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>Note that it doesn't matter where in your repository each
        project root is.  If you have only one project per repository,
        the logical place to put each project root is at the root of
        that project's respective repository.  If you have multiple
        projects, you might want to arrange them in groups inside the
        repository, perhaps putting projects with similar goals or
        shared code in the same subdirectory, or maybe just grouping
        them alphabetically.  Such an arrangement might look
        like this:</para>

      <screen>
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      &#x2026;
   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      &#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>Lay out your repository in whatever way you see fit.
        Subversion does not expect or enforce a particular layout&#x2014;in
        its eyes, a directory is a directory is a directory.
        Ultimately, you should choose the repository arrangement that
        meets the needs of the people who work on the projects that
        live there.</para>

      <para>In the name of full disclosure, though, we'll mention
        another very common layout.  In this layout, the
        <filename>trunk</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>, and
        <filename>branches</filename> directories live in the root
        directory of your repository, and your projects are in
        subdirectories beneath those, like so:</para>

      <screen>
/
   trunk/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      &#x2026;
   tags/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      &#x2026;
   branches/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      &#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a
        layout, but it may or may not seem as intuitive for your
        users.  Especially in large, multiproject situations with
        many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one
        or two of the projects in the repository.  But the
        projects-as-branch-siblings approach tends to deemphasize project
        individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a
        single entity.  That's a social issue, though.  We like our
        originally suggested arrangement for purely practical
        reasons&#x2014;it's easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate
        elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's
        a single repository path that holds the entire
        history&#x2014;past, present, tagged, and branched&#x2014;for
        that project and that project alone.</para>

      <title>Deciding Where and How to Host Your Repository</title>

      <para>Before creating your Subversion repository, an obvious
        question you'll need to answer is where the thing is going to
        live.  This is strongly connected to myriad other
        questions involving how the repository will be accessed (via a
        Subversion server or directly), by whom (users behind your
        corporate firewall or the whole world out on the open
        Internet), what other services you'll be providing around
        Subversion (repository browsing interfaces, email-based
        commit notification, etc.), your data backup strategy, and so
        on.</para>

      <para>We cover server choice and configuration in <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/>, but the point we'd like to
        briefly make here is simply that the answers to some of these
        other questions might have implications that force your hand
        when deciding where your repository will live.  For example,
        certain deployment scenarios might require accessing the
        repository via a remote filesystem from multiple computers, in
        which case (as you'll read in the next section) your choice of
        a repository backend data store turns out not to be a choice
        at all because only one of the available backends will work
        in this scenario.</para>

      <para>Addressing each possible way to deploy
        Subversion is both impossible and outside the scope of this
        book.  We simply encourage you to evaluate your options using
        these pages and other sources as your reference material and to
        plan ahead.</para>

      <para>There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these
        two backend types.  Neither of them is more
        <quote>official</quote> than the other, though the newer FSFS
        is the default data store as of Subversion 1.2.  Both are
        reliable enough to trust with your versioned data.  But as you
        can see in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.tbl-1"/>, the FSFS
        backend provides quite a bit more flexibility in terms of its
        supported deployment scenarios.  More flexibility means you
        have to work a little harder to find ways to deploy it
        incorrectly.  Those reasons&#x2014;plus the fact that not using
        Berkeley DB means there's one fewer component in the
        system&#x2014;largely explain why today almost everyone uses
        the FSFS backend when creating new repositories.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, most programs that access Subversion
        repositories are blissfully ignorant of which backend data
        store is in use.  And you aren't even necessarily stuck with
        your first choice of a data store&#x2014;in the event that you
        change your mind later, Subversion provides ways of migrating
        your repository's data into another repository that uses a
        different backend data store.  We talk more about that later
        in this chapter.</para>

      <para>The following subsections provide a more detailed look at
        the available backend data store types.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb">
        <title>Berkeley DB</title>
        
        <para>When the initial design phase of Subversion was in
          progress, the developers decided to use Berkeley DB for a
          variety of reasons, including its open source license,
          transaction support, reliability, performance, API
          simplicity, thread safety, support for cursors, and so
          on.</para>

        <para>Berkeley DB provides real transaction
          support&#x2014;perhaps its most powerful feature.  Multiple
          processes accessing your Subversion repositories don't have
          to worry about accidentally clobbering each other's data.
          The isolation provided by the transaction system is such
          that for any given operation, the Subversion repository code
          sees a static view of the database&#x2014;not a database that
          is constantly changing at the hand of some other
          process&#x2014;and can make decisions based on that view.  If
          the decision made happens to conflict with what another
          process is doing, the entire operation is rolled back as though
          it never happened, and Subversion gracefully retries the
          operation against a new, updated (and yet still static) view
          of the database.</para>

        <para>Another great feature of Berkeley DB is <firstterm>hot
          backups</firstterm>&#x2014;the ability to back up the
          database environment without taking it
          <quote>offline.</quote> We'll discuss how to back up your
          repository later in this chapter (in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.backup"/>), but the benefits
          of being able to make fully functional copies of your
          repositories without any downtime should be obvious.</para>

        <para>Berkeley DB is also a very reliable database system when
          properly used.  Subversion uses Berkeley DB's logging
          facilities, which means that the database first writes to
          on-disk logfiles a description of any modifications it is
          about to make, and then makes the modification itself.  This
          is to ensure that if anything goes wrong, the database
          system can back up to a previous
          <firstterm>checkpoint</firstterm>&#x2014;a location in the
          logfiles known not to be corrupt&#x2014;and replay
          transactions until the data is restored to a usable state.
          See <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace"/> later
          in this chapter for more about Berkeley DB logfiles.</para>

        <para>But every rose has its thorn, and so we must note some
          known limitations of Berkeley DB.  First, Berkeley DB
          environments are not portable.  You cannot simply copy a
          Subversion repository that was created on a Unix system onto
          a Windows system and expect it to work.  While much of the
          Berkeley DB database format is architecture-independent,
          other aspects of the environment are not.
          Second, Subversion uses Berkeley DB in a way that will not
          operate on Windows 95/98 systems&#x2014;if you need to house
          a BDB-backed repository on a Windows machine, stick with
          Windows 2000 or later.</para>

        <para>While Berkeley DB promises to behave correctly on
          network shares that meet a particular set of specifications,
          <footnote>
            <para>Berkeley DB requires that the underlying filesystem
              implement strict POSIX locking semantics, and more
              importantly, the ability to map files directly into
              process memory.</para>
          </footnote>
          most networked filesystem types and appliances do
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> actually meet those requirements.
          And in no case can you allow a BDB-backed repository that
          resides on a network share to be accessed by multiple
          clients of that share at once (which quite often is the
          whole point of having the repository live on a network share
          in the first place).</para>

        <warning>
          <para>If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a noncompliant
            remote filesystem, the results are unpredictable&#x2014;you
            may see mysterious errors right away, or it may be months
            before you discover that your repository database is
            subtly corrupted.  You should strongly consider using the
            FSFS data store for repositories that need to live on a
            network share.</para>
        </warning>
          
        <para>Finally, because Berkeley DB is a library linked
          directly into Subversion, it's more sensitive to
          interruptions than a typical relational database system.
          Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server
          process that mediates all access to tables.  If a program
          accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database
          daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess
          left behind.  And because the database daemon is the only
          process accessing the tables, applications don't need to
          worry about permission conflicts.  These things are not the
          case with Berkeley DB, however.  Subversion (and programs
          using Subversion libraries) access the database tables
          directly, which means that a program crash can leave the
          database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state.
          When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB
          to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance.
          Other things can cause a repository to <quote>wedge</quote>
          besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over
          ownership and permissions on the database files.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Berkeley DB 4.4 brings (to Subversion 1.4 and later)
            the ability for Subversion to automatically and
            transparently recover Berkeley DB environments in need of
            such recovery.  When a Subversion process attaches to a
            repository's Berkeley DB environment, it uses some process
            accounting mechanisms to detect any unclean disconnections
            by previous processes, performs any necessary recovery,
            and then continues on as though nothing happened.  This
            doesn't completely eliminate instances of repository
            wedging, but it does drastically reduce the amount of

        <para>So while a Berkeley DB repository is quite fast and
          scalable, it's best used by a single server process running
          as one user&#x2014;such as Apache's <command>httpd</command>
          or <command>svnserve</command> (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/>)&#x2014;rather than accessing it
          as many different users via <literal>file://</literal> or
          <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs.  If you're accessing a Berkeley
          DB repository directly as multiple users, be sure to read

        <title>FSFS</title>

        <para>In mid-2004, a second type of repository storage
          system&#x2014;one that doesn't use a database at
          all&#x2014;came into being.  An FSFS repository stores the
          changes associated with a revision in a single file, and so
          all of a repository's revisions can be found in a single
          subdirectory full of numbered files.  Transactions are
          created in separate subdirectories as individual files.
          When complete, the transaction file is renamed and moved
          into the revisions directory, thus guaranteeing that commits
          are atomic.  And because a revision file is permanent and
          unchanging, the repository also can be backed up while
          <quote>hot,</quote> just like a BDB-backed
          repository.</para>

        <para>The FSFS revision files describe a revision's
          directory structure, file contents, and deltas against files
          in other revision trees.  Unlike a Berkeley DB database,
          this storage format is portable across different operating
          systems and isn't sensitive to CPU architecture.  Because
          no journaling or shared-memory files are being used, the
          repository can be safely accessed over a network filesystem
          and examined in a read-only environment.  The lack of
          database overhead also means the overall repository
          size is a bit smaller.</para>

        <para>FSFS has different performance characteristics, too.
          When committing a directory with a huge number of files,
          FSFS is able to more quickly append directory entries.  On
          the other hand, FSFS writes the latest version of a file as
          a delta against an earlier version, which means that
          checking out the latest tree is a bit slower than fetching
          the full-texts stored in a Berkeley DB HEAD revision.  FSFS
          also has a longer delay when finalizing a commit, which
          could in extreme cases cause clients to time out while
          waiting for a response.</para>

        <para>The most important distinction, however, is FSFS's
          imperviousness to wedging when something goes wrong.  If a
          process using a Berkeley DB database runs into a permissions
          problem or suddenly crashes, the database can be left in an
          unusable state until an administrator recovers it.  If the
          same scenarios happen to a process using an FSFS repository,
          the repository isn't affected at all.  At worst, some
          transaction data is left behind.</para>

        <para>The only real argument against FSFS is its relative
          immaturity compared to Berkeley DB.  Unlike Berkeley DB,
          which has years of history, its own dedicated development
          team, and, now, Oracle's mighty name attached to it,
          <footnote>
            <para>Oracle bought Sleepycat and its flagship software,
              Berkeley DB, on Valentine's Day in 2006.</para>
          </footnote>
          FSFS is a newer bit of engineering.  Prior to Subversion
          1.4, it was still shaking out some pretty serious data
          integrity bugs, which, while triggered in only very rare
          cases, nonetheless did occur.  That said, FSFS has quickly
          become the backend of choice for some of the largest public
          and private Subversion repositories, and it promises a lower
          barrier to entry for Subversion across the board.</para>

      <title>Implementing Repository Hooks</title>

      <para>A <firstterm>hook</firstterm> is a program triggered by
        some repository event, such as the creation of a new revision
        or the modification of an unversioned property.  Some hooks
        (the so-called <quote>pre hooks</quote>) run in advance of a
        repository operation and provide a means by which to both
        report what is about to happen and prevent it from
        happening at all.  Other hooks (the <quote>post hooks</quote>)
        run after the completion of a repository event and are useful
        for performing tasks that examine&#x2014;but don't
        modify&#x2014;the repository.  Each hook is handed enough
        information to tell what that event is (or was), the specific
        repository changes proposed (or completed), and the username
        of the person who triggered the event.</para>
            
      <para>The <filename>hooks</filename> subdirectory is, by
        default, filled with templates for various repository
        hooks:</para>
            
      <screen>
$ ls repos/hooks/
post-commit.tmpl          post-unlock.tmpl  pre-revprop-change.tmpl
post-lock.tmpl            pre-commit.tmpl   pre-unlock.tmpl
post-revprop-change.tmpl  pre-lock.tmpl     start-commit.tmpl
$
</screen>
            
      <para>There is one template for each hook that the Subversion
        repository supports; by examining the contents of those
        template scripts, you can see what triggers each script
        to run and what data is passed to that script.  Also present
        in many of these templates are examples of how one might use
        that script, in conjunction with other Subversion-supplied
        programs, to perform common useful tasks.  To actually install
        a working hook, you need only place some executable program or
        script into the <filename>repos/hooks</filename> directory,
        which can be executed as the name (such as
        <command>start-commit</command> or
        <command>post-commit</command>) of the hook.</para>

      <para>On Unix platforms, this means supplying a script or
        program (which could be a shell script, a Python program, a
        compiled C binary, or any number of other things) named
        exactly like the name of the hook.  Of course, the template
        files are present for more than just informational
        purposes&#x2014;the easiest way to install a hook on Unix
        platforms is to simply copy the appropriate template file to a
        new file that lacks the <filename>.tmpl</filename> extension,
        customize the hook's contents, and ensure that the script is
        executable.  Windows, however, uses file extensions to
        determine whether a program is executable, so you would
        need to supply a program whose basename is the name of the
        hook and whose extension is one of the special extensions
        recognized by Windows for executable programs, such as
        <filename>.exe</filename> for programs and
        <filename>.bat</filename> for batch files.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>For security reasons, the Subversion repository executes
          hook programs with an empty environment&#x2014;that is, no
          environment variables are set at all, not even
          <literal>$PATH</literal> (or <literal>%PATH%</literal>,
          under Windows).  Because of this, many administrators
          are baffled when their hook program runs fine by hand, but
          doesn't work when run by Subversion.  Be sure to explicitly
          set any necessary environment variables in your hook program
          and/or use absolute paths to programs.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Subversion executes hooks as the same user who owns the
        process that is accessing the Subversion repository.  In most
        cases, the repository is being accessed via a Subversion
        server, so this user is the same user as whom the server
        runs on the system.  The hooks themselves will need to be
        configured with OS-level permissions that allow that user to
        execute them.  Also, this means that any programs or files
        (including the Subversion repository) accessed directly
        or indirectly by the hook will be accessed as the same user.
        In other words, be alert to potential permission-related
        problems that could prevent the hook from performing the tasks
        it is designed to perform.</para>

      <para>There are serveral hooks implemented by the Subversion
        repository, and you can get details about each of them in
        <xref linkend="svn.ref.reposhooks"/>.  As a repository
        administrator, you'll need to decide which hooks you wish
        to implement (by way of providing an appropriately named and
        permissioned hook program), and how.  When you make this
        decision, keep in mind
        the big picture of how your repository is deployed.
        For example, if you are using server configuration
        to determine which users are permitted to commit
        changes to your repository, you don't need to do this
        sort of access control via the hook system.</para>

      <para>There is no shortage of Subversion hook programs and
        scripts that are freely available either from the Subversion community
        itself or elsewhere.  These scripts cover a wide range of
        utility&#x2014;basic access control, policy adherence checking,
        issue tracker integration, email- or syndication-based commit
        notification, and beyond.  Or, if you wish to write your own,
        see <xref linkend="svn.developer"/>.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>While hook scripts can do almost
          anything, there is one dimension in which hook script
          authors should show restraint:  do <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          modify a commit transaction using hook scripts.  While it
          might be tempting to use hook scripts to automatically
          correct errors, shortcomings, or policy violations present
          in the files being committed, doing so can cause problems.
          Subversion keeps client-side caches of certain bits of
          repository data, and if you change a commit transaction in
          this way, those caches become indetectably stale.  This
          inconsistency can lead to surprising and unexpected
          behavior.  Instead of modifying the transaction, you should
          simply <emphasis>validate</emphasis> the transaction in the
          <filename>pre-commit</filename> hook and reject the commit
          if it does not meet the desired requirements.  As a
          bonus, your users will learn the value of careful,
          compliance-minded work habits.</para>

      <title>Berkeley DB Configuration</title>

      <para>A Berkeley DB environment is an encapsulation of one or
        more databases, logfiles, region files, and configuration
        files.  The Berkeley DB environment has its own set of default
        configuration values for things such as the number of database
        locks allowed to be taken out at any given time, the maximum
        size of the journaling logfiles, and so on.  Subversion's
        filesystem logic additionally chooses default values for some
        of the Berkeley DB configuration options.  However, sometimes
        your particular repository, with its unique collection of data
        and access patterns, might require a different set of
        configuration option values.</para>

      <para>The producers of Berkeley DB understand that different
        applications and database environments have different
        requirements, so they have provided a mechanism for overriding
        at runtime many of the configuration values for the Berkeley
        DB environment.  BDB checks for the presence of a file named
        <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> in the environment directory
        (namely, the repository's <filename>db</filename>
        subdirectory), and parses the options found in that file.
        Subversion itself creates this file when it creates the rest
        of the repository.  The file initially contains some default
        options, as well as pointers to the Berkeley DB online
        documentation so that you can read about what those options do.  Of
        course, you are free to add any of the supported Berkeley DB
        options to your <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> file.  Just be
        aware that while Subversion never attempts to read or
        interpret the contents of the file and makes no direct use of
        the option settings in it, you'll want to avoid any
        configuration changes that may cause Berkeley DB to behave in
        a fashion that is at odds with what Subversion might expect.
        Also, changes made to <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> won't
        take effect until you recover the database environment (using

        <para>This output is human-readable, meaning items such as the

          output is also machine-parsable&#x2014;because the log
          message can contain multiple lines and be unbounded in
          length, <command>svnlook</command> provides the length of
          that message before the message itself.  This allows scripts
          and other wrappers around this command to make intelligent
          decisions about the log message, such as how much memory to
          allocate for the message, or at least how many bytes to skip
          in the event that this output is not the last bit of data in
          the stream.</para>

        <para><command>svnlook</command> can perform a variety of

          job&#x2014;to transfer one repository's versioned history

        <title>fsfs-reshard.py</title>

        <para>While not an official member of the Subversion
          toolchain, the <command>fsfs-reshard.py</command> script
          (found in the <filename>tools/server-side</filename>
          directory of the Subversion source distribution) is a useful
          performance tuning tool for administrators of FSFS-backed
          Subversion repositories.  FSFS repositories contain files
          that describe the changes made in a single revision, and
          files that contain the revision properties associated with
          a single revision.  Repositories created in versions of
          Subversion prior to 1.5 keep these files in two
          directories&#x2014;one for each type of file.  As new
          revisions are committed to the repository, Subversion drops
          more files into these two directories&#x2014;over time, the
          number of these files in each directory can grow to be quite
          large.  This has been observed to cause performance problems
          on certain network-based filesystems.</para>

        <para>Subversion 1.5 creates FSFS-backed repositories using a
          slightly modified layout in which the contents of these two
          directories are <firstterm>sharded</firstterm>, or scattered
          across several subdirectories.  This can greatly reduce the
          time it takes the system to locate any one of these files,
          and therefore increases the overall performance of
          Subversion when reading from the repository.  The number of
          subdirectories used to house these files is configurable,
          though, and that's where
          <command>fsfs-reshard.py</command> comes in.  This script
          reshuffles the repository's file structure into a new
          arrangement that reflects the requested number of sharding
          subdirectories.  This is especially useful for converting an
          older Subversion repository into the new Subversion 1.5
          sharded layout (which Subversion will not automatically do
          for you) or for fine-tuning an already sharded
          repository.</para>

        <title>Berkeley DB utilities</title>

        <para>If you're using a Berkeley DB repository, all of
          your versioned filesystem's structure and data live in a set
          of database tables within the <filename>db/</filename>
          subdirectory of your repository.  This subdirectory is a
          regular Berkeley DB environment directory and can therefore
          be used in conjunction with any of the Berkeley database
          tools, typically provided as part of the Berkeley DB
          distribution.</para>

        <para>For day-to-day Subversion use, these tools are
          unnecessary.  Most of the functionality typically needed for
          Subversion repositories has been duplicated in the
          <command>svnadmin</command> tool.  For example,
          <command>svnadmin list-unused-dblogs</command> and
          <command>svnadmin list-dblogs</command> perform a
          subset of what is provided by the Berkeley
          <command>db_archive</command> utility, and <command>svnadmin
          recover</command> reflects the common use cases of the
          <command>db_recover</command> utility.</para>
            
        <para>However, there are still a few Berkeley DB utilities
          that you might find useful.  The <command>db_dump</command>
          and <command>db_load</command> programs write and read,
          respectively, a custom file format that describes the keys
          and values in a Berkeley DB database.  Since Berkeley
          databases are not portable across machine architectures,
          this format is a useful way to transfer those databases from
          machine to machine, irrespective of architecture or
          operating system.  As we describe later in this chapter, you
          can also use <command>svnadmin dump</command> and
          <command>svnadmin load</command> for similar purposes, but
          <command>db_dump</command> and <command>db_load</command>
          can do certain jobs just as well and much faster.  They can
          also be useful if the experienced Berkeley DB hacker needs
          to do in-place tweaking of the data in a BDB-backed
          repository for some reason, which is something Subversion's
          utilities won't allow.  Also, the <command>db_stat</command>
          utility can provide useful information about the status of
          your Berkeley DB environment, including detailed statistics
          about the locking and storage subsystems.</para>

        <title>How Subversion saves disk space</title>

        <para>To keep the repository small,
          Subversion uses <firstterm>deltification</firstterm> (or
          deltified storage) within the repository
          itself.  Deltification involves encoding the representation
          of a chunk of data as a collection of differences against
          some other chunk of data.  If the two pieces of data are
          very similar, this deltification results in storage savings
          for the deltified chunk&#x2014;rather than taking up space
          equal to the size of the original data, it takes up only
          enough space to say, <quote>I look just like this other
          piece of data over here, except for the following couple of
          changes.</quote>  The result is that most of the repository
          data that tends to be bulky&#x2014;namely, the contents of
          versioned files&#x2014;is stored at a much smaller size than
          the original full-text representation of that
          data.  And for repositories created with Subversion 1.4 or
          later, the space savings are even better&#x2014;now those
          full-text representations of file contents are themselves
          compressed.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Because all of the data that is subject to
            deltification in a BDB-backed repository is stored in a
            single Berkeley DB database file, reducing the size of the
            stored values will not immediately reduce the size of the
            database file itself.  Berkeley DB will, however, keep
            internal records of unused areas of the database file and
            consume those areas first before growing the size of the
            database file.  So while deltification doesn't produce
            immediate space savings, it can drastically slow future
            growth of the database.</para>

          administrator can often simply communicate with a seemingly
          dead transaction's owner (via email, e.g.) to verify
          that the transaction is, in fact, in a zombie state.</para>

        <title>Purging unused Berkeley DB logfiles</title>

        <para>Until recently, the largest offender of disk space usage
          with respect to BDB-backed Subversion repositories were the
          logfiles in which Berkeley DB performs its prewrites before
          modifying the actual database files.  These files capture
          all the actions taken along the route of changing the
          database from one state to another&#x2014;while the database
          files, at any given time, reflect a particular state, the
          logfiles contain all of the many changes along the way
          <emphasis>between</emphasis> states.  Thus, they can grow
          and accumulate quite rapidly.</para>

        <para>Fortunately, beginning with the 4.2 release of Berkeley
          DB, the database environment has the ability to remove its
          own unused logfiles automatically.  Any
          repositories created using <command>svnadmin</command>
          when compiled against Berkeley DB version 4.2 or later
          will be configured for this automatic logfile removal.  If
          you don't want this feature enabled, simply pass the
          <option>--bdb-log-keep</option> option to the
          <command>svnadmin create</command> command.  If you forget
          to do this or change your mind at a later time, simply edit
          the <filename>DB_CONFIG</filename> file found in your
          repository's <filename>db</filename> directory, comment out
          the line that contains the <literal>set_flags
          DB_LOG_AUTOREMOVE</literal> directive, and then run
          <command>svnadmin recover</command> on your repository to
          force the configuration changes to take effect.  See <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.bdb"/> for more information about
          database configuration.</para>

        <para>Without some sort of automatic logfile removal in
          place, logfiles will accumulate as you use your repository.
          This is actually somewhat of a feature of the database
          system&#x2014;you should be able to recreate your entire
          database using nothing but the logfiles, so these files can
          be useful for catastrophic database recovery.  But
          typically, you'll want to archive the logfiles that are no
          longer in use by Berkeley DB, and then remove them from disk
          to conserve space.  Use the <command>svnadmin
          list-unused-dblogs</command> command to list the unused
          logfiles:</para>

        <screen>
$ svnadmin list-unused-dblogs /var/svn/repos
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000031
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000032
/var/svn/repos/log.0000000033
&#x2026;
$ rm `svnadmin list-unused-dblogs /var/svn/repos`
## disk space reclaimed!
</screen>

        <warning>
          <para>BDB-backed repositories whose logfiles are used as
            part of a backup or disaster recovery plan should
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> make use of the logfile
            autoremoval feature.  Reconstruction of a repository's
            data from logfiles can only be accomplished only when
            <emphasis>all</emphasis> the logfiles are available.  If
            some of the logfiles are removed from disk before the
            backup system has a chance to copy them elsewhere, the

      <title>Berkeley DB Recovery</title>

      <para>As mentioned in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.bdb"/>, a Berkeley DB
        repository can sometimes be left in a frozen state if not closed
        properly.  When this happens, an administrator needs to rewind
        the database back into a consistent state.  This is unique to
        BDB-backed repositories, though&#x2014;if you are using
        FSFS-backed ones instead, this won't apply to you.  And for
        those of you using Subversion 1.4 with Berkeley DB 4.4 or
        later, you should find that Subversion has become much more
        resilient in these types of situations.  Still, wedged
        Berkeley DB repositories do occur, and an administrator needs
        to know how to safely deal with this circumstance.</para>

      <para>To protect the data in your repository, Berkeley
        DB uses a locking mechanism.  This mechanism ensures that
        portions of the database are not simultaneously modified by
        multiple database accessors, and that each process sees the
        data in the correct state when that data is being read from
        the database.  When a process needs to change something in the
        database, it first checks for the existence of a lock on the
        target data.  If the data is not locked, the process locks the
        data, makes the change it wants to make, and then unlocks the
        data.  Other processes are forced to wait until that lock is
        removed before they are permitted to continue accessing that
        section of the database.  (This has nothing to do with the
        locks that you, as a user, can apply to versioned files within
        the repository; we try to clear up the confusion caused by
        this terminology collision in the sidebar <xref linkend="svn.advanced.locking.meanings"/>.)</para>

      <para>In the course of using your Subversion repository, fatal
        errors or interruptions can prevent a process from having the
        chance to remove the locks it has placed in the database.  The
        result is that the backend database system gets
        <quote>wedged.</quote>  When this happens, any attempts to
        access the repository hang indefinitely (since each new
        accessor is waiting for a lock to go away&#x2014;which isn't
        going to happen).</para>

      <para>If this happens to your repository, don't panic.  The
        Berkeley DB filesystem takes advantage of database
        transactions, checkpoints, and prewrite journaling to
        ensure that only the most catastrophic of events
        <footnote>
          <para>For example, hard drive + huge electromagnet = disaster.</para>
        </footnote>
        can permanently destroy a database environment.  A
        sufficiently paranoid repository administrator will have made
        off-site backups of the repository data in some fashion, but
        don't head off to the tape backup storage closet just yet.</para>

      <para>Instead, use the following recipe to attempt to
        <quote>unwedge</quote> your repository:</para>
   
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Make sure no processes are accessing (or
            attempting to access) the repository.  For networked
            repositories, this also means shutting down the Apache HTTP
            Server or svnserve daemon.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem> 
          <para>Become the user who owns and manages the repository.
            This is important, as recovering a repository while
            running as the wrong user can tweak the permissions of the
            repository's files in such a way that your repository will
            still be inaccessible even after it is 
            <quote>unwedged.</quote></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Run the command <userinput>svnadmin recover
            /var/svn/repos</userinput>.  You should see output such as
            this:</para>
              
          <screen>
Repository lock acquired.
Please wait; recovering the repository may take some time...

Recovery completed.
The latest repos revision is 19.
</screen>
          <para>This command may take many minutes to complete.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Restart the server process.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
            
      <para>This procedure fixes almost every case of repository
        wedging.  Make sure that you run this command as the user that
        owns and manages the database, not just as
        <literal>root</literal>.  Part of the recovery process might
        involve re-creating from scratch various database files (shared
        memory regions, e.g.).  Recovering as
        <literal>root</literal> will create those files such that they
        are owned by <literal>root</literal>, which means that even
        after you restore connectivity to your repository, regular
        users will be unable to access it.</para>

      <para>If the previous procedure, for some reason, does not
        successfully unwedge your repository, you should do two
        things.  First, move your broken repository directory aside
        (perhaps by renaming it to something like
        <filename>repos.BROKEN</filename>) and then restore your
        latest backup of it.  Then, send an email to the Subversion
        users mailing list (at <email>users@subversion.tigris.org</email>)
        describing your problem in detail.  Data integrity is an
        extremely high priority to the Subversion developers.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate">
      <title>Migrating Repository Data Elsewhere</title>
    
      <para>A Subversion filesystem has its data spread throughout
        files in the repository, in a fashion generally
        understood by (and of interest to) only the Subversion
        developers themselves.  However, circumstances may arise that
        call for all, or some subset, of that data to be copied or
        moved into another repository.</para>

      <para>Subversion provides such functionality by way of
        <firstterm>repository dump streams</firstterm>.  A repository
        dump stream (often referred to as a <quote>dump file</quote>
        when stored as a file on disk) is a portable, flat file format
        that describes the various revisions in your
        repository&#x2014;what was changed, by whom, when, and so on.
        This dump stream is the primary mechanism used to marshal
        versioned history&#x2014;in whole or in part, with or without
        modification&#x2014;between repositories.  And Subversion
        provides the tools necessary for creating and loading these
        dump streams: the <command>svnadmin dump</command> and
        <command>svnadmin load</command> subcommands,
        respectively.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>While the Subversion repository dump format contains
          human-readable portions and a familiar structure (it
          resembles an RFC 822 format, the same type of format used
          for most email), it is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a plain-text
          file format.  It is a binary file format, highly sensitive
          to meddling.  For example, many text editors will corrupt
          the file by automatically converting line endings.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>There are many reasons for dumping and loading Subversion
        repository data.  Early in Subversion's life, the most common
        reason was due to the evolution of Subversion itself.  As
        Subversion matured, there were times when changes made to the
        backend database schema caused compatibility issues with
        previous versions of the repository, so users had to dump
        their repository data using the previous version of
        Subversion and load it into a freshly created repository with
        the new version of Subversion.  Now, these types of schema
        changes haven't occurred since Subversion's 1.0 release, and
        the Subversion developers promise not to force users to dump
        and load their repositories when upgrading between minor
        versions (such as from 1.3 to 1.4) of Subversion.  But there
        are still other reasons for dumping and loading, including
        re-deploying a Berkeley DB repository on a new OS or CPU
        architecture, switching between the Berkeley DB and FSFS
        backends, or (as we'll cover later in this chapter in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.filtering"/>) purging versioned
        data from repository history.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The Subversion repository dump format describes
          versioned repository changes only.  It will not carry any
          information about uncommitted transactions, user locks on
          filesystem paths, repository or server configuration
          customizations (including hook scripts), and so on.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Whatever your reason for migrating repository history,
        using the <command>svnadmin dump</command> and
        <command>svnadmin load</command> subcommands is
        straightforward.  <command>svnadmin dump</command> will output
        a range of repository revisions that are formatted using
        Subversion's custom filesystem dump format.  The dump format
        is printed to the standard output stream, while informative
        messages are printed to the standard error stream.  This
        allows you to redirect the output stream to a file while
        watching the status output in your terminal window.  For
        example:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnlook youngest myrepos
26
$ svnadmin dump myrepos &gt; dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
&#x2026;
* Dumped revision 25.
* Dumped revision 26.
</screen>

      <para>At the end of the process, you will have a single file
        (<filename>dumpfile</filename> in the previous example) that
        contains all the data stored in your repository in the
        requested range of revisions.  Note that <command>svnadmin
        dump</command> is reading revision trees from the repository
        just like any other <quote>reader</quote> process would
        (e.g., <command>svn checkout</command>), so it's safe
        to run this command at any time.</para>

      <para>The other subcommand in the pair, <command>svnadmin
        load</command>, parses the standard input stream as a
        Subversion repository dump file and effectively replays those
        dumped revisions into the target repository for that
        operation.  It also gives informative feedback, this time
        using the standard output stream:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : A ... done.
     * adding path : A/B ... done.
     &#x2026;
------- Committed new rev 1 (loaded from original rev 1) &gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 2
     * editing path : A/mu ... done.
     * editing path : A/D/G/rho ... done.

------- Committed new rev 2 (loaded from original rev 2) &gt;&gt;&gt;

&#x2026;

&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 25
     * editing path : A/D/gamma ... done.

------- Committed new rev 25 (loaded from original rev 25) &gt;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new txn, based on original revision 26
     * adding path : A/Z/zeta ... done.
     * editing path : A/mu ... done.

------- Committed new rev 26 (loaded from original rev 26) &gt;&gt;&gt;

</screen>

      <para>The result of a load is new revisions added to a
        repository&#x2014;the same thing you get by making commits
        against that repository from a regular Subversion client.
        Just as in a commit, you can use hook programs to perform
        actions before and after each of the commits made during a
        load process.  By passing the
        <option>--use-pre-commit-hook</option> and
        <option>--use-post-commit-hook</option> options to
        <command>svnadmin load</command>, you can instruct Subversion
        to execute the pre-commit and post-commit hook programs,
        respectively, for each loaded revision.  You might use these,
        for example, to ensure that loaded revisions pass through the
        same validation steps that regular commits pass through.  Of
        course, you should use these options with care&#x2014;if your
        post-commit hook sends emails to a mailing list for each new
        commit, you might not want to spew hundreds or thousands of
        commit emails in rapid succession at that list!  You can read more about the use of hook
        scripts in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.create.hooks"/>.</para>

      <para>Note that because <command>svnadmin</command> uses
        standard input and output streams for the repository dump and
        load processes, people who are feeling especially saucy can try
        things such as this (perhaps even using different versions of
        <command>svnadmin</command> on each side of the pipe):</para>
  
      <screen>
$ svnadmin create newrepos
$ svnadmin dump oldrepos | svnadmin load newrepos
</screen>

      <para>By default, the dump file will be quite large&#x2014;much
        larger than the repository itself.  That's because by default
        every version of every file is expressed as a full text in the
        dump file.  This is the fastest and simplest behavior, and
        it's nice if you're piping the dump data directly into some other
        process (such as a compression program, filtering program, or
        loading process).  But if you're creating a dump file
        for longer-term storage, you'll likely want to save disk space
        by using the <option>--deltas</option> option.  With this
        option, successive revisions of files will be output as
        compressed, binary differences&#x2014;just as file revisions
        are stored in a repository.  This option is slower, but it
        results in a dump file much closer in size to the original
        repository.</para>

      <para>We mentioned previously that <command>svnadmin
        dump</command> outputs a range of revisions.  Use the
        <option>--revision</option> (<option>-r</option>) option to
        specify a single revision, or a range of revisions, to dump.
        If you omit this option, all the existing repository revisions
        will be dumped.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 23 &gt; rev-23.dumpfile
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 100:200 &gt; revs-100-200.dumpfile
</screen>

      <para>As Subversion dumps each new revision, it outputs only
        enough information to allow a future loader to re-create that
        revision based on the previous one.  In other words, for any
        given revision in the dump file, only the items that were
        changed in that revision will appear in the dump.  The only
        exception to this rule is the first revision that is dumped
        with the current <command>svnadmin dump</command>
        command.</para>

      <para>By default, Subversion will not express the first dumped
        revision as merely differences to be applied to the previous
        revision.  For one thing, there is no previous revision in the
        dump file!  And second, Subversion cannot know the state of
        the repository into which the dump data will be loaded (if it
        ever is).  To ensure that the output of each
        execution of <command>svnadmin dump</command> is
        self-sufficient, the first dumped revision is, by default, a
        full representation of every directory, file, and property in
        that revision of the repository.</para>

      <para>However, you can change this default behavior.  If you add
        the <option>--incremental</option> option when you dump your
        repository, <command>svnadmin</command> will compare the first
        dumped revision against the previous revision in the
        repository&#x2014;the same way it treats every other revision that
        gets dumped.  It will then output the first revision exactly
        as it does the rest of the revisions in the dump
        range&#x2014;mentioning only the changes that occurred in that
        revision.  The benefit of this is that you can create several
        small dump files that can be loaded in succession, instead of
        one large one, like so:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 0:1000 &gt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 1001:2000 --incremental &gt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin dump myrepos -r 2001:3000 --incremental &gt; dumpfile3
</screen>

      <para>These dump files could be loaded into a new repository
        with the following command sequence:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile1
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile2
$ svnadmin load newrepos &lt; dumpfile3
</screen>

      <para>Another neat trick you can perform with this
        <option>--incremental</option> option involves appending to an
        existing dump file a new range of dumped revisions.  For
        example, you might have a <literal>post-commit</literal> hook
        that simply appends the repository dump of the single revision
        that triggered the hook.  Or you might have a script that runs
        nightly to append dump file data for all the revisions that
        were added to the repository since the last time the script
        ran.  Used like this, <command>svnadmin dump</command> can be
        one way to back up changes to your repository over time in case
        of a system crash or some other catastrophic event.</para>

      <para>The dump format can also be used to merge the contents of
        several different repositories into a single repository.  By
        using the <option>--parent-dir</option> option of
        <command>svnadmin load</command>, you can specify a new
        virtual root directory for the load process.  That means if
        you have dump files for three repositories&#x2014;say
        <filename>calc-dumpfile</filename>,
        <filename>cal-dumpfile</filename>, and
        <filename>ss-dumpfile</filename>&#x2014;you can first create a new
        repository to hold them all:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/projects
$
</screen>

      <para>Then, make new directories in the repository that will
        encapsulate the contents of each of the three previous
        repositories:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn mkdir -m "Initial project roots" \
      file:///var/svn/projects/calc \
      file:///var/svn/projects/calendar \
      file:///var/svn/projects/spreadsheet
Committed revision 1.

      <para>Lastly, load the individual dump files into their
        respective locations in the new repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calc &lt; calc-dumpfile
&#x2026;
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir calendar &lt; cal-dumpfile
&#x2026;
$ svnadmin load /var/svn/projects --parent-dir spreadsheet &lt; ss-dumpfile
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>We'll mention one final way to use the Subversion
        repository dump format&#x2014;conversion from a different
        storage mechanism or version control system altogether.
        Because the dump file format is, for the most part,
        human-readable, it should be relatively easy to describe
        generic sets of changes&#x2014;each of which should be treated
        as a new revision&#x2014;using this file format.  In fact, the
        <command>cvs2svn</command> utility (see <xref linkend="svn.forcvs.convert"/>) uses the dump format to
        represent the contents of a CVS repository so that those
        contents can be copied into a Subversion repository.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.maint.filtering">
      <title>Filtering Repository History</title>

      <para>Since Subversion stores your versioned history using, at
        the very least, binary differencing algorithms and data
        compression (optionally in a completely opaque database
        system), attempting manual tweaks is unwise if not quite
        difficult, and at any rate strongly discouraged.  And once
        data has been stored in your repository, Subversion
        generally doesn't provide an easy way to remove that data.
        <footnote>
          <para>That's rather the reason you use version control at
            all, right?</para>
        </footnote>
        But inevitably, there will be times when you would like to
        manipulate the history of your repository.  You might need
        to strip out all instances of a file that was accidentally
        added to the repository (and shouldn't be there for whatever
        reason).
        <footnote>
          <para>Conscious, cautious removal of certain bits of
            versioned data is actually supported by real use cases.
            That's why an <quote>obliterate</quote> feature has been
            one of the most highly requested Subversion features,
            and one which the Subversion developers hope to soon
            provide.</para>
        </footnote>
        Or, perhaps you have multiple projects sharing a
        single repository, and you decide to split them up into
        their own repositories.  To accomplish tasks such as these,
        administrators need a more manageable and malleable
        representation of the data in their repositories&#x2014;the
        Subversion repository dump format.</para>

      <para>As we described earlier in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate"/>, the Subversion
        repository dump format is a human-readable representation of
        the changes that you've made to your versioned data over time.
        Use the <command>svnadmin dump</command> command to generate
        the dump data, and <command>svnadmin load</command> to
        populate a new repository with it.  The great thing about the
        human-readability aspect of the dump format is that, if you
        aren't careless about it, you can manually inspect and modify
        it.  Of course, the downside is that if you have three years'
        worth of repository activity encapsulated in what is likely to
        be a very large dump file, it could take you a long, long time
        to manually inspect and modify it.</para>

      <para>That's where <command>svndumpfilter</command> becomes
        useful.  This program acts as a path-based filter for
        repository dump streams.  Simply give it either a list of
        paths you wish to keep or a list of paths you wish to not
        keep, and then pipe your repository dump data through this
        filter.  The result will be a modified stream of dump data
        that contains only the versioned paths you (explicitly or
        implicitly) requested.</para>

      <para>Let's look at a realistic example of how you might use this
        program.  Earlier in this chapter (see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"/>), we discussed the
        process of deciding how to choose a layout for the data in
        your repositories&#x2014;using one repository per project or
        combining them, arranging stuff within your repository, and
        so on.  But sometimes after new revisions start flying in,
        you rethink your layout and would like to make some changes.
        A common change is the decision to move multiple projects
        that are sharing a single repository into separate
        repositories for each project.</para>

      <para>Our imaginary repository contains three projects:
        <literal>calc</literal>, <literal>calendar</literal>, and
        <literal>spreadsheet</literal>.  They have been living
        side-by-side in a layout like this:</para>

      <screen>
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      branches/
      tags/
</screen>

      <para>To get these three projects into their own repositories,
        we first dump the whole repository:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin dump /var/svn/repos &gt; repos-dumpfile
* Dumped revision 0.
* Dumped revision 1.
* Dumped revision 2.
* Dumped revision 3.
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>Next, run that dump file through the filter, each time
        including only one of our top-level directories.  This results
        in three new dump files:</para>

      <screen>
$ svndumpfilter include calc &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; calc-dumpfile
&#x2026;
$ svndumpfilter include calendar &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; cal-dumpfile
&#x2026;
$ svndumpfilter include spreadsheet &lt; repos-dumpfile &gt; ss-dumpfile
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>At this point, you have to make a decision.  Each of your
        dump files will create a valid repository, but will preserve
        the paths exactly as they were in the original repository.
        This means that even though you would have a repository solely
        for your <literal>calc</literal> project, that repository
        would still have a top-level directory named
        <filename>calc</filename>.  If you want your
        <filename>trunk</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>, and
        <filename>branches</filename> directories to live in the root
        of your repository, you might wish to edit your dump files,
        tweaking the <literal>Node-path</literal> and
        <literal>Node-copyfrom-path</literal> headers so that they no
        longer have that first <filename>calc/</filename> path
        component.  Also, you'll want to remove the section of dump
        data that creates the <filename>calc</filename> directory.  It
        will look something like the following:</para>

      <screen>
Node-path: calc
Node-action: add
Node-kind: dir
Content-length: 0
  
</screen>

      <warning>
        <para>If you do plan on manually editing the dump file to
          remove a top-level directory, make sure your editor is
          not set to automatically convert end-of-line characters to
          the native format (e.g., <literal>\r\n</literal> to
          <literal>\n</literal>), as the content will then not agree
          with the metadata.  This will render the dump file
          useless.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>All that remains now is to create your three new
        repositories, and load each dump file into the right
        repository, ignoring the UUID found in the dump stream:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin create calc
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid calc &lt; calc-dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : button.c ... done.
&#x2026;
$ svnadmin create calendar
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid calendar &lt; cal-dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : cal.c ... done.
&#x2026;
$ svnadmin create spreadsheet
$ svnadmin load --ignore-uuid spreadsheet &lt; ss-dumpfile
&lt;&lt;&lt; Started new transaction, based on original revision 1
     * adding path : Makefile ... done.
     * adding path : ss.c ... done.
&#x2026;
$
</screen>

      <para>Both of <command>svndumpfilter</command>'s subcommands
        accept options for deciding how to deal with
        <quote>empty</quote> revisions.  If a given revision
        contains only changes to paths that were filtered out, that
        now-empty revision could be considered uninteresting or even
        unwanted.  So to give the user control over what to do with
        those revisions, <command>svndumpfilter</command> provides
        the following command-line options:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><option>--drop-empty-revs</option></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Do not generate empty revisions at all&#x2014;just
              omit them.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><option>--renumber-revs</option></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>If empty revisions are dropped (using the
              <option>--drop-empty-revs</option> option), change the
              revision numbers of the remaining revisions so that
              there are no gaps in the numeric sequence.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><option>--preserve-revprops</option></term>
          <listitem>
            <para>If empty revisions are not dropped, preserve the
              revision properties (log message, author, date, custom
              properties, etc.) for those empty revisions.
              Otherwise, empty revisions will contain only the
              original datestamp, and a generated log message that
              indicates that this revision was emptied by
              <command>svndumpfilter</command>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      
      <para>While <command>svndumpfilter</command> can be very
        useful and a huge timesaver, there are unfortunately a
        couple of gotchas.  First, this utility is overly sensitive
        to path semantics.  Pay attention to whether paths in your
        dump file are specified with or without leading slashes.
        You'll want to look at the <literal>Node-path</literal> and
        <literal>Node-copyfrom-path</literal> headers.</para>

      <screen>
&#x2026;
Node-path: spreadsheet/Makefile
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>If the paths have leading slashes, you should
        include leading slashes in the paths you pass to
        <command>svndumpfilter include</command> and
        <command>svndumpfilter exclude</command> (and if they don't,
        you shouldn't).  Further, if your dump file has an inconsistent
        usage of leading slashes for some reason,
        <footnote>
          <para>While <command>svnadmin dump</command> has a
            consistent leading slash policy (to not include
            them), other programs that generate dump data might
            not be so consistent.</para>
        </footnote>
        you should probably normalize those paths so that they all
        have, or all lack, leading slashes.</para>

      <para>Also, copied paths can give you some trouble.
        Subversion supports copy operations in the repository, where
        a new path is created by copying some already existing path.
        It is possible that at some point in the lifetime of your
        repository, you might have copied a file or directory from
        some location that <command>svndumpfilter</command> is
        excluding, to a location that it is including.  To
        make the dump data self-sufficient,
        <command>svndumpfilter</command> needs to still show the
        addition of the new path&#x2014;including the contents of any
        files created by the copy&#x2014;and not represent that
        addition as a copy from a source that won't exist in your
        filtered dump data stream.  But because the Subversion
        repository dump format shows only what was changed in each
        revision, the contents of the copy source might not be
        readily available.  If you suspect that you have any copies
        of this sort in your repository, you might want to rethink
        your set of included/excluded paths, perhaps including the
        paths that served as sources of your troublesome copy
        operations, too.</para>

      <para>Finally, <command>svndumpfilter</command> takes path
        filtering quite literally.  If you are trying to copy the
        history of a project rooted at
        <filename>trunk/my-project</filename> and move it into a
        repository of its own, you would, of course, use the
        <command>svndumpfilter include</command> command to keep all
        the changes in and under
        <filename>trunk/my-project</filename>.  But the resultant
        dump file makes no assumptions about the repository into
        which you plan to load this data.  Specifically, the dump
        data might begin with the revision that added the
        <filename>trunk/my-project</filename> directory, but it will
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> contain directives that would
        create the <filename>trunk</filename> directory itself
        (because <filename>trunk</filename> doesn't match the
        include filter).  You'll need to make sure that any
        directories that the new dump stream expects to exist
        actually do exist in the target repository before trying to
        load the stream into that repository.</para>

    </sect2>
  
    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication">
      <title>Repository Replication</title>

      <para>There are several scenarios in which it is quite handy to
        have a Subversion repository whose version history is exactly
        the same as some other repository's.  Perhaps the most obvious
        one is the maintenance of a simple backup repository, used
        when the primary repository has become inaccessible due to a
        hardware failure, network outage, or other such annoyance.
        Other scenarios include deploying mirror repositories to
        distribute heavy Subversion load across multiple servers, use
        as a soft-upgrade mechanism, and so on.</para>

      <para>As of version 1.4, Subversion provides a program for
        managing scenarios such as
        these&#x2014;<command>svnsync</command>.  This works by
        essentially asking the Subversion server to
        <quote>replay</quote> revisions, one at a time.  It then uses
        that revision information to mimic a commit of the same to
        another repository.  Neither repository needs to be locally
        accessible to the machine on which <command>svnsync</command> is
        running&#x2014;its parameters are repository URLs, and it does
        all its work through Subversion's Repository Access (RA)
        interfaces.  All it requires is read access to the source
        repository and read/write access to the destination
        repository.</para>

      <note>
        <para>When using <command>svnsync</command> against a remote
          source repository, the Subversion server for that repository
          must be running Subversion version 1.4 or later.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Assuming you already have a source repository that you'd
        like to mirror, the next thing you need is an empty target
        repository that will actually serve as that mirror.  This
        target repository can use either of the available filesystem
        data-store backends (see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends"/>), but it must not
        yet have any version history in it.  The protocol that
        <command>svnsync</command> uses to communicate revision information
        is highly sensitive to mismatches between the versioned
        histories contained in the source and target repositories.
        For this reason, while <command>svnsync</command> cannot
        <emphasis>demand</emphasis> that the target repository be
        read-only,
        <footnote>
          <para>In fact, it can't truly be read-only, or
            <command>svnsync</command> itself would have a tough time
            copying revision history into it.</para>
        </footnote>
        allowing the revision history in the target repository to
        change by any mechanism other than the mirroring process is a
        recipe for disaster.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> modify a mirror repository
          in such a way as to cause its version history to deviate
          from that of the repository it mirrors.  The only commits
          and revision property modifications that ever occur on that
          mirror repository should be those performed by the
          <command>svnsync</command> tool.</para>
      </warning>

      <para>Another requirement of the target repository is that the
        <command>svnsync</command> process be allowed to modify
        revision properties.  Because <command>svnsync</command> works
        within the framework of that repository's hook system, the
        default state of the repository (which is to disallow revision
        property changes; see <xref linkend="svn.ref.reposhooks.pre-revprop-change"/>) is
        insufficient.  You'll need to explicitly implement the
        pre-revprop-change hook, and your script must allow
        <command>svnsync</command> to set and change revision
        properties.  With those provisions in place, you are ready to
        start mirroring repository revisions.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>It's a good idea to implement authorization measures
          that allow your repository replication process to perform
          its tasks while preventing other users from modifying the
          contents of your mirror repository at all.</para>
      </tip>

      <para>Let's walk through the use of <command>svnsync</command>
        in a somewhat typical mirroring scenario.  We'll pepper this
        discourse with practical recommendations, which you are free to
        disregard if they aren't required by or suitable for your
        environment.</para>

      <para>As a service to the fine developers of our favorite
        version control system, we will be mirroring the public
        Subversion source code repository and exposing that mirror
        publicly on the Internet, hosted on a different machine than
        the one on which the original Subversion source code
        repository lives.  This remote host has a global configuration
        that permits anonymous users to read the contents of
        repositories on the host, but requires users to authenticate
        to modify those repositories.  (Please forgive us for
        glossing over the details of Subversion server configuration
        for the moment&#x2014;those are covered thoroughly in <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig"/>.)  And for no other reason than
        that it makes for a more interesting example, we'll be driving
        the replication process from a third machine&#x2014;the one that
        we currently find ourselves using.</para>

      <para>First, we'll create the repository which will be our
        mirror.  This and the next couple of steps do require shell
        access to the machine on which the mirror repository will
        live.  Once the repository is all configured, though, we
        shouldn't need to touch it directly again.</para>

      <screen>
$ ssh admin@svn.example.com \
      "svnadmin create /var/svn/svn-mirror"
admin@svn.example.com's password: ********
$
</screen>

      <para>At this point, we have our repository, and due to our
        server's configuration, that repository is now
        <quote>live</quote> on the Internet.  Now, because we don't
        want anything modifying the repository except our replication
        process, we need a way to distinguish that process from other
        would-be committers.  To do so, we use a dedicated username
        for our process.  Only commits and revision property
        modifications performed by the special username
        <literal>syncuser</literal> will be allowed.</para>

      <para>We'll use the repository's hook system both to allow the
        replication process to do what it needs to do and to enforce
        that only it is doing those things.  We accomplish this by
        implementing two of the repository event
        hooks&#x2014;pre-revprop-change and start-commit.  Our
        <filename>pre-revprop-change</filename> hook script is found
        in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.pre-revprop-change"/>, and basically verifies that the user attempting the
        property changes is our <literal>syncuser</literal> user.  If
        so, the change is allowed; otherwise, it is denied.</para>

      <example id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.pre-revprop-change">
        <title>Mirror repository's pre-revprop-change hook script</title>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh 

USER="$3"

if [ "$USER" = "syncuser" ]; then exit 0; fi

echo "Only the syncuser user may change revision properties" &gt;&amp;2
exit 1
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>That covers revision property changes.  Now we need to
        ensure that only the <literal>syncuser</literal> user is
        permitted to commit new revisions to the repository.  We do
        this using a <filename>start-commit</filename> hook scripts
        such as the one in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.start-commit"/>.</para>

      <example id="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.start-commit">
        <title>Mirror repository's start-commit hook script</title>

        <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh 

USER="$2"

if [ "$USER" = "syncuser" ]; then exit 0; fi

echo "Only the syncuser user may commit new revisions" &gt;&amp;2
exit 1
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>After installing our hook scripts and ensuring that they
        are executable by the Subversion server, we're finished with
        the setup of the mirror repository.  Now, we get to actually
        do the mirroring.</para>

      <para>The first thing we need to do with
        <command>svnsync</command> is to register in our target
        repository the fact that it will be a mirror of the source
        repository.  We do this using the <command>svnsync
        initialize</command> subcommand.  The URLs we provide point to
        the root directories of the target and source repositories,
        respectively.  In Subversion 1.4, this is required&#x2014;only
        full mirroring of repositories is permitted.  In Subversion
        1.5, though, you can use <command>svnsync</command> to mirror
        only some subtree of the repository, too.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnsync help init

      <para>Our target repository will now remember that it is a
        mirror of the public Subversion source code repository.
        Notice that we provided a username and password as arguments
        to <command>svnsync</command>&#x2014;that was required by the
        pre-revprop-change hook on our mirror repository.</para>

      <note>
        <para>In Subversion 1.4, the values given to
          <command>svnsync</command>'s <option>--username</option> and
          <option>--password</option> command-line options were used
          for authentication against both the source and destination
          repositories.  This caused problems when a user's
          credentials weren't exactly the same for both repositories,
          especially when running in noninteractive mode (with the
          <option>--non-interactive</option> option).</para>

        <para>This has been fixed in Subversion 1.5 with the
          introduction of two new pairs of options.  Use
          <option>--source-username</option> and
          <option>--source-password</option> to provide authentication
          credentials for the source repository; use
          <option>--sync-username</option> and
          <option>--sync-password</option> to provide credentials for
          the destination repository.  (The old
          <option>--username</option> and <option>--password</option>
          options still exist for compatibility, but we advise against
          using them.)</para>

      </note>

      <para>And now comes the fun part.  With a single subcommand, we
        can tell <command>svnsync</command> to copy all the
        as-yet-unmirrored revisions from the source repository to the
        target.
        <footnote>
          <para>Be forewarned that while it will take only a few
            seconds for the average reader to parse this paragraph and
            the sample output that follows it, the actual time
            required to complete such a mirroring operation is, shall
            we say, quite a bit longer.</para>
        </footnote>
        The <command>svnsync synchronize</command> subcommand will
        peek into the special revision properties previously stored on
        the target repository, and determine both what repository it
        is mirroring as well as that the most recently mirrored
        revision was revision 0.  Then it will query the source
        repository and determine what the latest revision in that
        repository is.  Finally, it asks the source repository's
        server to start replaying all the revisions between 0 and that
        latest revision.  As <command>svnsync</command> get the
        resultant response from the source repository's server, it
        begins forwarding those revisions to the target repository's
        server as new commits.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnsync help synchronize

      <para>Of particular interest here is that for each mirrored
        revision, there is first a commit of that revision to the
        target repository, and then property changes follow.  This is
        because the initial commit is performed by (and attributed to)
        the user <literal>syncuser</literal>, and it is datestamped
        with the time as of that revision's creation.  Also,
        Subversion's underlying repository access interfaces don't
        provide a mechanism for setting arbitrary revision properties
        as part of a commit.  So <command>svnsync</command> follows up
        with an immediate series of property modifications that copy
        into the target repository all the revision properties found
        for that revision in the source repository.  This also has the
        effect of fixing the author and datestamp of the revision to
        match that of the source repository.</para>

      <para>Also noteworthy is that <command>svnsync</command>
        performs careful bookkeeping that allows it to be safely
        interrupted and restarted without ruining the integrity of the
        mirrored data.  If a network glitch occurs while mirroring a
        repository, simply repeat the <command>svnsync
        synchronize</command> command, and it will happily pick up
        right where it left off.  In fact, as new revisions appear in
        the source repository, this is exactly what you to do
        to keep your mirror up to date.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>svnsync Bookkeeping</title>

        <para><command>svnsync</command> needs to be able to set and
          modify revision properties on the mirror repository because
          those properties are part of the data it is tasked with
          mirroring.  As those properties change in the source
          repository, those changes need to be reflected in the mirror
          repository, too.  But <command>svnsync</command> also uses a
          set of custom revision properties&#x2014;stored in revision 0
          of the mirror repository&#x2014;for its own internal
          bookkeeping.  These properties contain information such as
          the URL and UUID of the source repository, plus some
          additional state-tracking information.</para>

        <para>One of those pieces of state-tracking information is a
          flag that essentially just means <quote>there's a
          synchronization in progress right now.</quote>  This is used
          to prevent multiple <command>svnsync</command> processes
          from colliding with each other while trying to mirror data
          to the same destination repository.  Now, generally you
          won't need to pay any attention whatsoever to
          <emphasis>any</emphasis> of these special properties (all of
          which begin with the prefix <literal>svn:sync-</literal>).
          Occasionally, though, if a synchronization fails
          unexpectedly, Subversion never has a chance to remove this
          particular state flag.  This causes all future
          synchronization attempts to fail because it appears that a
          synchronization is still in progress when, in fact, none is.
          Fortunately, recovering from this situation is as simple as
          removing the <literal>svn:sync-lock</literal> property which
          serves as this flag from revision 0 of the mirror
          repository:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn propdel --revprop -r0 svn:sync-lock http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
property 'svn:sync-lock' deleted from repository revision 0
$
</screen>

        <para>That <command>svnsync</command> stores the source
          repository URL in a bookkeeping property on the mirror
          repository is the reason why you have to specify that
          URL only once, during <command>svnsync init</command>.  Future
          synchronization operations against that mirror simply
          consult the special <literal>svn:sync-from-url</literal>
          property stored on the mirror itself to know where
          to synchronize from.  This value is used literally by the
          synchronization process, though.  So while from within
          CollabNet's network you can perhaps access our example
          source URL as <literal>http://svn/repos/svn</literal>
          (because that first <literal>svn</literal> magically gets
          <literal>.collab.net</literal> appended to it by DNS
          voodoo), if you later need to update that mirror from
          another machine outside CollabNet's network, the
          synchronization might fail (because the hostname
          <literal>svn</literal> is ambiguous).  For this reason, it's
          best to use fully qualified source repository URLs when
          initializing a mirror repository rather than those that
          refer to only hostnames or IP addresses (which can change
          over time).  But here again, if you need an existing mirror
          to start referring to a different URL for the same source
          repository, you can change the bookkeeping property which
          houses that information:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn propset --revprop -r0 svn:sync-from-url <replaceable>NEW-SOURCE-URL</replaceable> \
      http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror
property 'svn:sync-from-url' set on repository revision 0
$
</screen>

        <para>Another interesting thing about these special
          bookkeeping properties is that <command>svnsync</command>
          will not attempt to mirror any of those properties when they
          are found in the source repository.  The reason is probably
          obvious, but basically boils down to
          <command>svnsync</command> not being able to distinguish the
          special properties it has merely copied from the source
          repository from those it needs to consult and maintain for
          its own bookkeeping needs.  This situation could occur if,
          for example, you were maintaining a mirror of a mirror of a
          third repository.  When <command>svnsync</command> sees its
          own special properties in revision 0 of the source
          repository, it simply ignores them.</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>There is, however, one bit of inelegance in the process.
        Because Subversion revision properties can be changed at any
        time throughout the lifetime of the repository, and because
        they don't leave an audit trail that indicates when they were
        changed, replication processes have to pay special attention
        to them.  If you've already mirrored the first 15 revisions of
        a repository and someone then changes a revision property on
        revision 12, <command>svnsync</command> won't know to go back
        and patch up its copy of revision 12.  You'll need to tell it
        to do so manually by using (or with some additional tooling
        around) the <command>svnsync copy-revprops</command>
        subcommand, which simply rereplicates all the revision
        properties for a particular revision or range thereof.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnsync help copy-revprops
copy-revprops: usage: svnsync copy-revprops DEST_URL [REV[:REV2]]

Copy the revision properties in a given range of revisions to the
destination from the source with which it was initialized.
&#x2026;
$ svnsync copy-revprops http://svn.example.com/svn-mirror 12
Copied properties for revision 12.
$
</screen>

      <para>That's repository replication in a nutshell.  You'll
        likely want some automation around such a process.  For
        example, while our example was a pull-and-push setup, you
        might wish to have your primary repository push changes to one
        or more blessed mirrors as part of its post-commit and
        post-revprop-change hook implementations.  This would enable
        the mirror to be up to date in as near to real time as is
        likely possible.</para>

      <para>Also, while it isn't very commonplace to do so,
        <command>svnsync</command> does gracefully mirror repositories
        in which the user as whom it authenticates has only partial
        read access.  It simply copies only the bits of the repository
        that it is permitted to see.  Obviously, such a mirror is not
        useful as a backup solution.</para>

      <para>In Subversion 1.5, <command>svnsync</command> grew the
        ability to also mirror a subset of a repository rather than
        the whole thing.  The process of setting up and maintaining
        such a mirror is exactly the same as when mirroring a whole
        repository, except that instead of specifying the source
        repository's root URL when running <command>svnsync
        init</command>, you specify the URL of some subdirectory
        within that repository.  Synchronization to that mirror will
        now copy only the bits that changed under that source
        repository subdirectory.  There are some limitations to this
        support, though.  First, you can't mirror multiple disjoint
        subdirectories of the source repository into a single mirror
        repository&#x2014;you'd need to instead mirror some parent
        directory that is common to both.  Second, the filtering
        logic is entirely path-based, so if the subdirectory you are
        mirroring was renamed at some point in the past, your mirror
        would contain only the revisions since the directory appeared
        at the URL you specified.  And likewise, if the source
        subdirectory is renamed in the future, your synchronization
        processes will stop mirroring data at the point that the
        source URL you specified is no longer valid.</para>

      <para>As far as user interaction with repositories and mirrors
        goes, it <emphasis>is</emphasis> possible to have a single
        working copy that interacts with both, but you'll have to jump
        through some hoops to make it happen.  First, you need to
        ensure that both the primary and mirror repositories have the
        same repository UUID (which is not the case by default).  See
        <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids"/> later in this
        chapter for more about this.</para>
        
      <para>Once the two repositories have the same UUID, you can use
        <command>svn switch</command> with the <option>--relocate</option> option to point your working
        copy to whichever of the repositories you wish to operate
        against, a process that is described in <xref linkend="svn.ref.svn.c.switch"/>.  There is a possible danger
        here, though, in that if the primary and mirror repositories
        aren't in close synchronization, a working copy up to date
        with, and pointing to, the primary repository will, if
        relocated to point to an out-of-date mirror, become confused
        about the apparent sudden loss of revisions it fully expects
        to be present, and it will throw errors to that effect.  If
        this occurs, you can relocate your working copy back to the
        primary repository and then either wait until the mirror
        repository is up to date, or backdate your working copy to a
        revision you know is present in the sync repository, and then
        retry the relocation.</para>

      <para>Finally, be aware that the revision-based replication
        provided by <command>svnsync</command> is only
        that&#x2014;replication of revisions.  Only information carried
        by the Subversion repository dump file format is available for
        replication.  As such, <command>svnsync</command> has the same
        sorts of limitations that the repository dump stream has, and
        does not include such things as the hook implementations,
        repository or server configuration data, uncommitted
        transactions, or information about user locks on repository
        paths.</para>

      <title>Repository Backup</title>

      <para>Despite numerous advances in technology since the birth of
        the modern computer, one thing unfortunately rings true with
        crystalline clarity&#x2014;sometimes things go very, very
        awry.  Power outages, network connectivity dropouts, corrupt
        RAM, and crashed hard drives are but a taste of the evil that
        Fate is poised to unleash on even the most conscientious
        administrator.  And so we arrive at a very important
        topic&#x2014;how to make backup copies of your repository
        data.</para>

      <para>There are two types of backup methods available for
        Subversion repository administrators&#x2014;full and
        incremental.  A full backup of the repository involves
        squirreling away in one sweeping action all the information
        required to fully reconstruct that repository in the event of
        a catastrophe.  Usually, it means, quite literally, the
        duplication of the entire repository directory (which includes
        either a Berkeley DB or FSFS environment).  Incremental
        backups are lesser things:  backups of only the portion of the
        repository data that has changed since the previous
        backup.</para>

      <para>As far as full backups go, the na&#xEF;ve approach might seem
        like a sane one, but unless you temporarily disable all other
        access to your repository, simply doing a recursive directory
        copy runs the risk of generating a faulty backup.  In the case
        of Berkeley DB, the documentation describes a certain order in
        which database files can be copied that will guarantee a valid
        backup copy.  A similar ordering exists for FSFS data.  But
        you don't have to implement these algorithms yourself, because
        the Subversion development team has already done so.  The
        <command>svnadmin hotcopy</command> command takes care of the
        minutia involved in making a hot backup of your repository.
        And its invocation is as trivial as the Unix
        <command>cp</command> or Windows <command>copy</command>
        operations:</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin hotcopy /var/svn/repos /var/svn/repos-backup
</screen>

      <para>The resultant backup is a fully functional Subversion
        repository, able to be dropped in as a replacement for your
        live repository should something go horribly wrong.</para>

      <para>When making copies of a Berkeley DB repository, you can
        even instruct <command>svnadmin hotcopy</command> to purge any
        unused Berkeley DB logfiles (see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.bdblogs"/>) from the
        original repository upon completion of the copy.  Simply
        provide the <option>--clean-logs</option> option on the
        command line.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin hotcopy --clean-logs /var/svn/bdb-repos /var/svn/bdb-repos-backup
</screen>

      <para>Additional tooling around this command is available, too.
        The <filename>tools/backup/</filename> directory of the
        Subversion source distribution holds the
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> script.  This script adds a
        bit of backup management atop <command>svnadmin
        hotcopy</command>, allowing you to keep only the most recent
        configured number of backups of each repository.  It will
        automatically manage the names of the backed-up repository
        directories to avoid collisions with previous backups and
        will <quote>rotate off</quote> older backups, deleting them so
        that only the most recent ones remain.  Even if you also have an
        incremental backup, you might want to run this program on a
        regular basis.  For example, you might consider using
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> from a program scheduler
        (such as <command>cron</command> on Unix systems), which can
        cause it to run nightly (or at whatever granularity of time
        you deem safe).</para>

      <para>Some administrators use a different backup mechanism built
        around generating and storing repository dump data.  We
        described in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate"/>
        how to use <command>svnadmin dump</command> with the <option>--incremental</option> option to
        perform an incremental backup of a given revision or range of
        revisions.  And of course, you can achieve a full backup variation of
        this by omitting the <option>--incremental</option>
        option to that command.  There is some value in these methods,
        in that the format of your backed-up information is
        flexible&#x2014;it's not tied to a particular platform,
        versioned filesystem type, or release of Subversion or
        Berkeley DB.  But that flexibility comes at a cost, namely
        that restoring that data can take a long time&#x2014;longer
        with each new revision committed to your repository.  Also, as
        is the case with so many of the various backup methods,
        revision property changes that are made to already backed-up
        revisions won't get picked up by a nonoverlapping,
        incremental dump generation.  For these reasons, we recommend
        against relying solely on dump-based backup approaches.</para>

      <para>As you can see, each of the various backup types and
        methods has its advantages and disadvantages.  The easiest is
        by far the full hot backup, which will always result in a
        perfect working replica of your repository.  Should something
        bad happen to your live repository, you can restore from the
        backup with a simple recursive directory copy.  Unfortunately,
        if you are maintaining multiple backups of your repository,
        these full copies will each eat up just as much disk space as
        your live repository.  Incremental backups, by contrast, tend
        to be quicker to generate and smaller to store.  But the
        restoration process can be a pain, often involving applying
        multiple incremental backups.  And other methods have their
        own peculiarities.  Administrators need to find the balance
        between the cost of making the backup and the cost of
        restoring it.</para>

      <para>The <command>svnsync</command> program (see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication"/>) actually
        provides a rather handy middle-ground approach.  If you are
        regularly synchronizing a read-only mirror with your main
        repository, in a pinch your read-only mirror is probably
        a good candidate for replacing that main repository if it
        falls over.  The primary disadvantage of this method is that
        only the versioned repository data gets
        synchronized&#x2014;repository configuration files,
        user-specified repository path locks, and other items that
        might live in the physical repository directory but not
        <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the repository's virtual versioned
        filesystem are not handled by <command>svnsync</command>.</para>

      <para>In any backup scenario, repository administrators need
        to be aware of how modifications to unversioned revision
        properties affect their backups.  Since these changes do not
        themselves generate new revisions, they will not trigger
        post-commit hooks, and may not even trigger the
        pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hooks.

        And since you can change revision properties without respect
        to chronological order&#x2014;you can change any revision's
        properties at any time&#x2014;an incremental backup of the

      <para>Generally speaking, only the truly paranoid would need to
        back up their entire repository, say, every time a commit
        occurred.  However, assuming that a given repository has some
        other redundancy mechanism in place with relatively fine
        granularity (such as per-commit emails or incremental dumps), a
        hot backup of the database might be something that a
        repository administrator would want to include as part of a
        system-wide nightly backup.  It's your data&#x2014;protect it
        as much as you'd like.</para>
            
      <para>Often, the best approach to repository backups is a
        diversified one that leverages combinations of the methods
        described here.  The Subversion developers, for example, back
        up the Subversion source code repository nightly using
        <command>hot-backup.py</command> and an off-site
        <command>rsync</command> of those full backups; keep multiple
        archives of all the commit and property change notification
        emails; and have repository mirrors maintained by various
        volunteers using <command>svnsync</command>.  Your solution
        might be similar, but should be catered to your needs and that
        delicate balance of convenience with paranoia.  And whatever
        you do, validate your backups from time to time&#x2014;what
        good is a spare tire that has a hole in it?  While all of this
        might not save your hardware from the iron fist of Fate,

      <title>Managing Repository UUIDs</title>

      <para>Subversion repositories have a universally unique
        identifier (UUID) associated with them.  This is used by
        Subversion clients to verify the identity of a repository when
        other forms of verification aren't good enough (such as
        checking the repository URL, which can change over time).
        Most Subversion repository administrators rarely, if ever,
        need to think about repository UUIDs as anything more than a
        trivial implementation detail of Subversion.  Sometimes,
        however, there is cause for attention to this detail.</para>

      <para>As a general rule, you want the UUIDs of your live
        repositories to be unique.  That is, after all, the point of
        having UUIDs.  But there are times when you want the
        repository UUIDs of two repositories to be exactly the same.
        For example, if you make a copy of a repository for backup
        purposes, you want the backup to be a perfect replica of the
        original so that, in the event that you have to restore that
        backup and replace the live repository, users don't suddenly
        see what looks like a different repository.  When dumping and
        loading repository history (as described earlier in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate"/>), you get to decide
        whether to apply the UUID encapsulated in the data dump
        stream to the repository in which you are loading the data.  The
        particular circumstance will dictate the correct
        behavior.</para>

      <para>There are a couple of ways to set (or reset) a
        repository's UUID, should you need to.  As of Subversion 1.5,
        this is as simple as using the <command>svnadmin
        setuuid</command> command.  If you provide this subcommand
        with an explicit UUID, it will validate that the UUID is
        well-formed and then set the repository UUID to that value.
        If you omit the UUID, a brand-new UUID will be generated for
        your repository.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos   # generate a new UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
3c3c38fe-acc0-11dc-acbc-1b37ff1c8e7c
$ svnadmin setuuid /var/svn/repos \
           cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec  # restore the old UUID
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$
</screen>

      <para>For folks using versions of Subversion earlier than 1.5,
        these tasks are a little more complicated.  You can explicitly
        set a repository's UUID by piping a repository dump file stub
        that carries the new UUID specification through
        <userinput>svnadmin load --force-uuid <replaceable>REPOS-PATH</replaceable></userinput>.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnadmin load --force-uuid /var/svn/repos &lt;&lt;EOF
SVN-fs-dump-format-version: 2

UUID: cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
EOF
$ svnlook uuid /var/svn/repos
cf2b9d22-acb5-11dc-bc8c-05e83ce5dbec
$
</screen>

      <para>Having older versions of Subversion generate a brand-new
        UUID is not quite as simple to do, though.  Your best bet here
        is to find some other way to generate a UUID, and then
        explicitly set the repository's UUID to that value.</para>

    <title>Moving and Removing Repositories</title>

    <para>Subversion repository data is wholly contained within the
      repository directory.  As such, you can move a Subversion
      repository to some other location on disk, rename a repository,
      copy a repository, or delete a repository altogether using the
      tools provided by your operating system for manipulating
      directories&#x2014;<command>mv</command>, <command>cp
      -a</command>, and <command>rm -r</command> on Unix platforms;
      <command>copy</command>, <command>move</command>, and
      <command>rmdir /s /q</command> on Windows; vast numbers of mouse
      and menu gyrations in various graphical file explorer
      applications, and so on.</para>

    <para>Of course, there's often still more to be done when trying
      to cleanly affect changes such as this.  For example, you might
      need to update your Subversion server configuration to point to
      the new location of a relocated repository or to remove
      configuration bits for a now-deleted repository.  If you have
      automated processes that publish information from or about your
      repositories, they may need to be updated.  Hook scripts might
      need to be reconfigured.  Users may need to be notified.  The list
      can go on indefinitely, or at least to the extent that you've
      built processes and procedures around your Subversion
      repository.</para>

    <para>In the case of a copied repository, you should also consider
      the fact that Subversion uses repository UUIDs to distinguish
      repositories.  If you copy a Subversion repository using a
      typical shell recursive copy command, you'll wind up with two
      repositories that are identical in every way&#x2014;including their UUIDs.
      In some circumstances, this might be desirable.  But in the
      instances where it is not, you'll need to generate a new UUID
      for one of these identical repositories.  See <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.uuids"/> for more about managing
      repository UUIDs.</para>

  <title>Server Configuration</title>

  <para>A Subversion repository can be accessed simultaneously by
    clients running on the same machine on which the repository
    resides using the <literal>file://</literal> method.  But the
    typical Subversion setup involves a single server machine being
    accessed from clients on computers all over the office&#x2014;or,
    perhaps, all over the world.</para>

  <para>This chapter describes how to get your Subversion repository
    exposed outside its host machine for use by remote clients.  We
    will cover Subversion's currently available server mechanisms,
    discussing the configuration and use of each.  After reading this
    chapter, you should be able to decide which networking setup is
    right for your needs, as well as understand how to enable such a
    setup on your host computer.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.serverconfig.overview">

    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>Subversion was designed with an abstract network layer.
      This means that a repository can be programmatically accessed by
      any sort of server process, and the client <quote>repository
      access</quote> API allows programmers to write plug-ins that
      speak relevant network protocols.  In theory, Subversion can use
      an infinite number of network implementations.  In practice,
      there are only two servers at the time of this writing.</para>

    <para>Apache is an extremely popular web server; using the
      <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module, Apache can access a
      repository and make it available to clients via the
      WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an extension of HTTP.  Because
      Apache is an extremely extensible server, it provides a number
      of features <quote>for free,</quote> such as encrypted SSL
      communication, logging, integration with a number of third-party
      authentication systems, and limited built-in web browsing of
      repositories.</para>

    <para>In the other corner is <command>svnserve</command>: a small,
      lightweight server program that speaks a custom protocol with
      clients.  Because its protocol is explicitly designed for
      Subversion and is stateful (unlike HTTP), it provides
      significantly faster network operations&#x2014;but at the cost of
      some features as well.  While it can use SASL to provide a
      variety of authentication and encryption options, it has no
      logging or built-in web browsing.  It is, however, extremely
      easy to set up and is often the best option for small teams just
      starting out with Subversion.</para>

    <para>A third option is to use <command>svnserve</command>
      tunneled over an SSH connection.  Even though this scenario
      still uses <command>svnserve</command>, it differs quite a bit
      in features from a traditional <command>svnserve</command>
      deployment.  SSH is used to encrypt all communication.  SSH is
      also used exclusively to authenticate, so real system accounts
      are required on the server host (unlike
      vanilla <command>svnserve</command>, which has its own private
      user accounts).  Finally, because this setup requires that each
      user spawn a private, temporary <command>svnserve</command>
      process, it's equivalent (from a permissions point of view) to
      allowing a group of local users to all access the repository
      via <literal>file://</literal> URLs. Path-based access control
      has no meaning, since each user is accessing the repository
      database files directly.</para>

      quick summary of the three typical server deployments.</para>

      <title>Recommendations</title>

      <para>In general, the authors of this book recommend a vanilla
        <command>svnserve</command> installation for small teams just
        trying to get started with a Subversion server; it's the
        simplest to set up and has the fewest maintenance issues.
        You can always switch to a more complex server
        deployment as your needs change.</para>

      <para>Here are some general recommendations and tips, based on
        years of supporting users:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If you're trying to set up the simplest possible
            server for your group, a
            vanilla <command>svnserve</command> installation is the
            easiest, fastest route.  Note, however, that your
            repository data will be transmitted in the clear over the
            network.  If your deployment is entirely within your
            company's LAN or VPN, this isn't an issue.  If the
            repository is exposed to the wide-open Internet, you
            might want to make sure that either the repository's
            contents aren't sensitive (e.g., it contains only
            open source code), or that you go the extra mile in
            configuring SASL to encrypt network communications.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you need to integrate with existing legacy identity
            systems (LDAP, Active Directory, NTLM, X.509, etc.),
            you must use either the Apache-based server
            or <command>svnserve</command> configured with SASL.  If
            you absolutely need server-side logs of either server
            errors or client activities, an Apache-based server
            is your only option.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
           <para>If you've decided to use either Apache or stock
             <command>svnserve</command>, create a single
             <command>svn</command> user on your system and run the
             server process as that user.  Be sure to make the
             repository directory wholly owned by the
             <command>svn</command> user as well.  From a security
             point of view, this keeps the repository data nicely
             siloed and protected by operating system filesystem
             permissions, changeable by only the Subversion server
             process itself.</para> </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If you have an existing infrastructure that is heavily based
            on SSH accounts, and if your users already have system
            accounts on your server machine, it makes sense to
            deploy an <command>svnserve</command>-over-SSH solution.
            Otherwise, we don't widely recommend this option to the
            public.  It's generally considered safer to have your
            users access the repository via (imaginary) accounts
            managed by <command>svnserve</command> or Apache, rather
            than by full-blown system accounts.  If your deep desire
            for encrypted communication still draws you to this
            option, we recommend using Apache with SSL or
            <command>svnserve</command> with SASL encryption
            instead.</para> </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> be seduced by the simple
            idea of having all of your users access a repository
            directly via <literal>file://</literal> URLs.  Even if the
            repository is readily available to everyone via a network
            share, this is a bad idea.  It removes any layers of
            protection between the users and the repository: users can
            accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt the repository
            database, it becomes hard to take the repository offline
            for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a mess of
            file permission problems (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>).  Note that this
            is also one of the reasons we warn against accessing
            repositories via <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
            URLs&#x2014;from a security standpoint, it's effectively
            the same as local users accessing via
            <literal>file://</literal>, and it can entail all the same
            problems if the administrator isn't careful.</para>

    <title>svnserve, a Custom Server</title>

    <para>The <command>svnserve</command> program is a lightweight
      server, capable of speaking to clients over TCP/IP using a
      custom, stateful protocol.  Clients contact an
      <command>svnserve</command> server by using URLs that begin with
      the <literal>svn://</literal> or <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
      scheme.  This section will explain the different ways of running
      <command>svnserve</command>, how clients authenticate themselves
      to the server, and how to configure appropriate access control
      to your repositories.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->

      <title>Invoking the Server</title>

      <para>There are a few different ways to run the

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.daemon">
        <title>svnserve as daemon</title>

        <para>The easiest option is to run <command>svnserve</command>
          as a standalone <quote>daemon</quote> process.  Use the
          <option>-d</option> option for this:</para>

        <screen>
$ svnserve -d
$               # svnserve is now running, listening on port 3690
</screen>

        <para>When running <command>svnserve</command> in daemon mode,
          you can use the <option>--listen-port</option> and
          <option>--listen-host</option> options to customize the
          exact port and hostname to <quote>bind</quote> to.</para>

      <para>Once we successfully start <command>svnserve</command> as
        explained previously, it makes every repository on your system
        available to the network.  A client needs to specify an
        <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> path in the repository URL.  For
        example, if a repository is located at
        <filename>/var/svn/project1</filename>, a client would
        reach it via
        <uri>svn://host.example.com/var/svn/project1</uri>.  To
        increase security, you can pass the <option>-r</option> option
        to <command>svnserve</command>, which restricts it to
        exporting only repositories below that path.  For
        example:</para>
      
      <screen>
$ svnserve -d -r /var/svn
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>Using the <option>-r</option> option effectively
        modifies the location that the program treats as the root of
        the remote filesystem space.  Clients then use URLs that
        have that path portion removed from them, leaving much
        shorter (and much less revealing) URLs:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn checkout svn://host.example.com/project1

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.inetd">
        <title>svnserve via inetd</title>

        <para>If you want <command>inetd</command> to launch the
          process, you need to pass the <option>-i</option>
          (<option>--inetd</option>) option.  In the following
          example, we've shown the output from running
          <literal>svnserve -i</literal> at the command line, but note
          that this isn't how you actually start the daemon; see the
          paragraphs following the example for how to configure
          <command>inetd</command> to start
          <command>svnserve</command>.</para>

      <screen>
$ svnserve -i
( success ( 1 2 ( ANONYMOUS ) ( edit-pipeline ) ) )
</screen>

      <para>When invoked with the <option>--inetd</option> option,
        <command>svnserve</command> attempts to speak with a
        Subversion client via <filename>stdin</filename> and
        <filename>stdout</filename> using a custom protocol.  This is
        the standard behavior for a program being run via
        <command>inetd</command>.  The IANA has reserved port 3690 for
        the Subversion protocol, so on a Unix-like system you can add
        lines to <filename>/etc/services</filename> such as these (if
        they don't already exist):</para>

      <screen>
svn           3690/tcp   # Subversion
svn           3690/udp   # Subversion
</screen>

      <para>If your system is using a classic Unix-like
        <command>inetd</command> daemon, you can add this line to
        <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>:</para>

      <screen>
svn stream tcp nowait svnowner /usr/bin/svnserve svnserve -i
</screen>

      <para>Make sure <quote>svnowner</quote> is a user that has
        appropriate permissions to access your repositories.  Now,
        when a client connection comes into your server on port 3690,
        <command>inetd</command> will spawn an
        <command>svnserve</command> process to service it.  Of course,
        you may also want to add <option>-r</option> to the
        configuration line as well, to restrict which repositories are
        exported.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.tunnel">
        <title>svnserve over a tunnel</title>

        <para>A third way to invoke <command>svnserve</command> is in
          tunnel mode, using the <option>-t</option> option.  This
          mode assumes that a remote-service program such as
          <command>rsh</command> or <command>ssh</command> has
          successfully authenticated a user and is now invoking a
          private <command>svnserve</command> process <emphasis>as
          that user</emphasis>.  (Note that you, the user, will
          rarely, if ever, have reason to invoke
          <command>svnserve</command> with the <option>-t</option> at
          the command line; instead, the SSH daemon
          does so for you.)  The <command>svnserve</command> program
          behaves normally (communicating via
          <filename>stdin</filename> and <filename>stdout</filename>)
          and assumes that the traffic is being automatically
          redirected over some sort of tunnel back to the client.
          When <command>svnserve</command> is invoked by a tunnel
          agent like this, be sure that the authenticated user has
          full read and write access to the repository database files.
          It's essentially the same as a local user accessing the
          repository via <literal>file://</literal> URLs.</para>

          this chapter in <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshauth"/>.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.invoking.winservice">
        <title>svnserve as Windows service</title>

        <para>If your Windows system is a descendant of Windows NT
          (2000, 2003, XP, or Vista), you can
          run <command>svnserve</command> as a standard Windows
          service.  This is typically a much nicer experience than
          running it as a standalone daemon with the <option>--daemon
          (-d)</option> option.  Using daemon mode requires launching
          a console, typing a command, and then leaving the console
          window running indefinitely.  A Windows service, however,
          runs in the background, can start at boot time
          automatically, and can be started and stopped using the same
          consistent administration interface as other
          Windows services. </para>

        <para>You'll need to define the new service using the
          command-line tool <command>SC.EXE</command>.  Much like
          the <command>inetd</command> configuration line, you must
          specify an exact invocation of <command>svnserve</command>
          for Windows to run at startup time:</para>

        <screen>
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "C:\svn\bin\svnserve.exe --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</screen>

        <para>This defines a new Windows service named
          <quote>svn,</quote> which executes a particular
          <command>svnserve.exe</command> command when started (in
          this case, rooted at <filename>C:\repos</filename>).  There
          are a number of caveats in the prior example,
          however.</para>

        <para>First, notice that the <command>svnserve.exe</command>
          program must always be invoked with the
          <option>--service</option> option.  Any other options to
          <command>svnserve</command> must then be specified on the
          same line, but you cannot add conflicting options such as
          <option>--daemon (-d)</option>, <option>--tunnel</option>,
          or <option>--inetd (-i)</option>.  Options such as
          <option>-r</option> or <option>--listen-port</option> are
          fine, though.  Second, be careful about spaces when invoking
          the <command>SC.EXE</command> command: the <literal>key=
          value</literal> patterns must have no spaces between
          <literal>key=</literal> and must have exactly one space
          before the <literal>value</literal>.  Lastly, be careful
          about spaces in your command line to be invoked.  If a
          directory name contains spaces (or other characters that
          need escaping), place the entire inner value of
          <literal>binpath</literal> in double quotes, by escaping
          them:</para>

        <screen>
C:\&gt; sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
</screen>

        <para>Also note that the word <literal>binpath</literal> is
          misleading&#x2014;its value is a <emphasis>command
          line</emphasis>, not the path to an executable.  That's why
          you need to surround it with quotes if it contains
          embedded spaces.</para>

        <para>Once the service is defined, it can be stopped, started,
          or queried using standard GUI tools (the Services
          administrative control panel), or at the command
          line:</para>

        <screen>
C:\&gt; net stop svn
C:\&gt; net start svn
</screen>

        <para>The service can also be uninstalled (i.e., undefined) by
          deleting its definition:  <userinput>sc delete svn</userinput>.
          Just be sure to stop the service first!
          The <command>SC.EXE</command> program has many other
          subcommands and options; run <userinput>sc /?</userinput> to
          learn more about it.</para>

        the server sends a small amount of data to the client.  The
        client uses the MD5 hash algorithm to create a fingerprint of
        the data and password combined, and then sends the fingerprint
        as a response.  The server performs the same computation with

      <para>If your <command>svnserve</command> server was built with

      <para>It's also possible, of course, for the client to be

      <para>As you've already guessed, a repository's

          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> has all the variables you
          need.  Begin by changing the values of those variables:
          choose a name for a file that will contain your usernames
          and passwords and choose an authentication realm:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm
</screen>

        <para>The <literal>realm</literal> is a name that you define.
          It tells clients which sort of <quote>authentication
          namespace</quote> they're connecting to; the Subversion
          client displays it in the authentication prompt and uses it
          as a key (along with the server's hostname and port) for
          caching credentials on disk (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  The
          <literal>password-db</literal> variable points to a separate
          file that contains a list of usernames and passwords, using
          the same familiar format.  For example:</para>

        <screen>
[users]
harry = foopassword
sally = barpassword
</screen>

        <para>The value of <literal>password-db</literal> can be an
          absolute or relative path to the users file.  For many
          admins, it's easy to keep the file right in the
          <filename>conf/</filename> area of the repository, alongside
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>.  On the other hand, it's
          possible you may want to have two or more repositories share
          the same users file; in that case, the file should probably
          live in a more public place.  The repositories sharing the
          users file should also be configured to have the same realm,
          since the list of users essentially defines an
          authentication realm.  Wherever the file lives, be sure to
          set the file's read and write permissions appropriately.  If
          you know which user(s) <command>svnserve</command> will run
          as, restrict read access to the users file as necessary.</para>

        <title>Set access controls</title>

        <para>There are two more variables to set in the
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file: they determine what
          unauthenticated (anonymous) and authenticated users are
          allowed to do.  The variables <literal>anon-access</literal>
          and <literal>auth-access</literal> can be set to the value
          <literal>none</literal>, <literal>read</literal>, or
          <literal>write</literal>.  Setting the value to
          <literal>none</literal> prohibits both reading and writing;
          <literal>read</literal> allows read-only access to the
          repository, and <literal>write</literal> allows complete
          read/write access to the repository.  For example:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users can only read the repository
anon-access = read

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</screen>

        <para>The example settings are, in fact, the default values of
          the variables, should you forget to define them.  If you
          want to be even more conservative, you can block anonymous
          access completely:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# anonymous users aren't allowed
anon-access = none

# authenticated users can both read and write
auth-access = write
</screen>

        <para>The server process understands not only
        these <quote>blanket</quote> access controls to the
        repository, but also finer-grained access restrictions placed
        on specific files and directories within the repository.  To
        make use of this feature, you need to define a file containing
        more detailed rules, and then set
        the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable to point to it:</para>

        <screen>
[general]
password-db = userfile
realm = example realm

# Specific access rules for specific locations
authz-db = authzfile
</screen>

        <para>We discuss the syntax of the <filename>authzfile</filename> file
          in detail later in this chapter, in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz"/>.  Note
          that the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable isn't mutually
          exclusive with the <literal>anon-access</literal>
          and <literal>auth-access</literal> variables;  if all the
          variables are defined at once, <emphasis>all</emphasis>
          of the rules must be satisfied before access is allowed.</para>

      <title>Using <command>svnserve</command> with SASL</title>

      <para>For many teams, the built-in CRAM-MD5 authentication is
        all they need from <command>svnserve</command>.  However, if
        your server (and your Subversion clients) were built with the
        Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) library,
        you have a number of authentication and encryption
        options available to you.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>What Is SASL?</title>
        <para>The Cyrus Simple Authentication and Security Layer is
          open source software written by Carnegie Mellon University.
          It adds generic authentication and encryption capabilities
          to any network protocol, and as of Subversion 1.5 and later,
          both the <command>svnserve</command> server
          and <command>svn</command> client know how to make use of
          this library.  It may or may not be available to you: if
          you're building Subversion yourself, you'll need to have at
          least version 2.1 of SASL installed on your system, and
          you'll need to make sure that it's detected during
          Subversion's build process.  If you're using a prebuilt
          Subversion binary package, you'll have to check with the
          package maintainer as to whether SASL support was compiled
          in.  SASL comes with a number of pluggable modules that
          represent different authentication systems: Kerberos
          (GSSAPI), NTLM, One-Time-Passwords (OTP), DIGEST-MD5, LDAP,
          Secure-Remote-Password (SRP), and others.  Certain
          mechanisms may or may not be available to you; be sure to
          check which modules are provided.</para>

        <para>You can download Cyrus SASL (both code and
          documentation) from
          <ulink url="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/sasl-library.html"/>.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Normally, when a subversion client connects to
        <command>svnserve</command>, the server sends a greeting that
        advertises a list of the capabilities it supports, and the
        client responds with a similar list of capabilities.  If the
        server is configured to require authentication, it then sends
        a challenge that lists the authentication mechanisms
        available; the client responds by choosing one of the
        mechanisms, and then authentication is carried out in some
        number of round-trip messages.  Even when SASL capabilities
        aren't present, the client and server inherently know how to
        use the CRAM-MD5 and ANONYMOUS mechanisms (see
        <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.auth"/>).  If server
        and client were linked against SASL, a number of other
        authentication mechanisms may also be available.  However,
        you'll need to explicitly configure SASL on the server side to
        advertise them.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.authn">
        <title>Authenticating with SASL</title>

        <para>To activate specific SASL mechanisms on the server,
          you'll need to do two things.  First, create
          a <literal>[sasl]</literal> section in your
          repository's <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file with an
          initial key-value pair:</para>

        <programlisting>
          [sasl]
          use-sasl = true
</programlisting>

        <para>Second, create a main SASL configuration file
          called <filename>svn.conf</filename> in a place where the
          SASL library can find it&#x2014;typically in the directory
          where SASL plug-ins are located.  You'll have to locate the
          plug-in directory on your particular system, such
          as <filename>/usr/lib/sasl2/</filename>
          or <filename>/etc/sasl2/</filename>.  (Note that this
          is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
          the <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file that lives
          within a repository!)</para>

        <para>On a Windows server, you'll also have to edit the system
          registry (using a tool such as <command>regedit</command>)
          to tell SASL where to find things.  Create a registry key
          named <literal>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Carnegie
          Mellon\Project Cyrus\SASL Library]</literal>, and place two
          keys inside it: a key called <literal>SearchPath</literal>
          (whose value is a path to the directory containing the SASL
          <filename>sasl*.dll</filename> plug-in libraries), and a key
          called
          <literal>ConfFile</literal> (whose value is a path to the
          parent directory containing
          the <filename>svn.conf</filename> file you created).</para>

        <para>Because SASL provides so many different kinds of
          authentication mechanisms, it would be foolish (and far
          beyond the scope of this book) to try to describe every
          possible server-side configuration.  Instead, we recommend
          that you read the documentation supplied in the
          <filename>doc/</filename> subdirectory of the SASL source
          code.  It goes into great detail about every mechanism and
          how to configure the server appropriately for each.  For the
          purposes of this discussion, we'll just demonstrate a simple
          example of configuring the DIGEST-MD5 mechanism.  For
          example, if your <filename>subversion.conf</filename>
          (or <filename>svn.conf</filename>) file contains the
          following:</para>

        <screen>
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
sasldb_path: /etc/my_sasldb
mech_list: DIGEST-MD5
</screen>

        <para>you've told SASL to advertise the DIGEST-MD5
          mechanism to clients and to check user passwords against a
          private password database located
          at <filename>/etc/my_sasldb</filename>.  A system
          administrator can then use
          the <command>saslpasswd2</command> program to add or modify
          usernames and passwords in the database:</para>

        <screen>
$ saslpasswd2 -c -f /etc/my_sasldb -u realm username
</screen>

        <para>A few words of warning: first, make sure the
          <quote>realm</quote> argument
          to <command>saslpasswd2</command> matches the same realm
          you've defined in your
          repository's <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file; if
          they don't match, authentication will fail.  Also, due to a
          shortcoming in SASL, the common realm must be a string with
          no space characters.  Finally, if you decide to go with the
          standard SASL password database, make sure
          the <command>svnserve</command> program has read access to
          the file (and possibly write access as well, if you're using
          a mechanism such as OTP).</para>

        <para>This is just one simple way of configuring SASL.  Many
          other authentication mechanisms are available, and passwords
          can be stored in other places such as in LDAP or a SQL
          database.  Consult the full SASL documentation for
          details.</para>

        <para>Remember that if you configure your server to only allow
          certain SASL authentication mechanisms, this forces all
          connecting clients to have SASL support as well.  Any
          Subversion client built without SASL support (which includes
          all pre-1.5 clients) will be unable to authenticate.  On the
          one hand, this sort of restriction may be exactly what you
          want (<quote>My clients must all use Kerberos!</quote>).
          However, if you still want non-SASL clients to be able to
          authenticate, be sure to advertise the CRAM-MD5 mechanism as
          an option.  All clients are able to use CRAM-MD5, whether
          they have SASL capabilities or not.</para>

        </sect3>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sasl.encryption">
        <title>SASL encryption</title>

        <para>SASL is also able to perform data encryption if a
          particular mechanism supports it.  The built-in CRAM-MD5
          mechanism doesn't support encryption, but DIGEST-MD5 does,
          and mechanisms such as SRP actually require use of the
          OpenSSL library.  To enable or disable different levels of
          encryption, you can set two values in your repository's
          <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file:</para>

        <screen>
[sasl]
use-sasl = true
min-encryption = 128
max-encryption = 256
</screen>

        <para>The <literal>min-encryption</literal> and
          <literal>max-encryption</literal> variables control the
          level of encryption demanded by the server.  To disable
          encryption completely, set both values to 0.  To enable
          simple checksumming of data (i.e., prevent tampering and
          guarantee data integrity without encryption), set both
          values to 1.  If you wish to allow&#x2014;but not
          require&#x2014;encryption, set the minimum value to 0, and
          the maximum value to some bit length.  To require encryption
          unconditionally, set both values to numbers greater than 1.
          In our previous example, we require clients to do at least
          128-bit encryption, but no more than 256-bit
          encryption.</para>

      <title>Tunneling over SSH</title>

      <para><command>svnserve</command>'s built-in authentication (and
        SASL support) can be very handy, because it avoids the need to
        create real system accounts.  On the other hand, some
        administrators already have well-established SSH
        authentication frameworks in place.  In these situations, all
        of the project's users already have system accounts and the
        ability to <quote>SSH into</quote> the server machine.</para>

      <para>It's easy to use SSH in conjunction with
        <command>svnserve</command>.  The client simply uses the
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URL scheme to connect:</para>

      <screen>
$ whoami
harry

$ svn list svn+ssh://host.example.com/repos/project
harryssh@host.example.com's password:  *****

foo
bar
baz
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>In this example, the Subversion client is invoking a local
        <command>ssh</command> process, connecting to
        <literal>host.example.com</literal>, authenticating as the
        user <literal>harryssh</literal> (according to SSH user
        configuration), then spawning a private
        <command>svnserve</command> process on the remote machine
        running as the user <literal>harryssh</literal>.  The
        <command>svnserve</command> command is being invoked in tunnel
        mode (<option>-t</option>), and its network protocol is being
        <quote>tunneled</quote> over the encrypted connection by
        <command>ssh</command>, the tunnel agent.
        If the client performs a commit, the authenticated username
        <literal>harryssh</literal> will be used as the author
        of the new revision.</para>

      <para>The important thing to understand here is that the
        Subversion client is <emphasis>not</emphasis> connecting to a
        running <command>svnserve</command> daemon.  This method of
        access doesn't require a daemon, nor does it notice one if
        present.  It relies wholly on the ability of
        <command>ssh</command> to spawn a temporary
        <command>svnserve</command> process, which then terminates
        when the network connection is closed.</para>

      <para>When using <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs to access a
        repository, remember that it's the <command>ssh</command>
        program prompting for authentication, and
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> the <command>svn</command> client
        program.  That means there's no automatic password-caching
        going on (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  The
        Subversion client often makes multiple connections to the
        repository, though users don't normally notice this due to the
        password caching feature.  When using
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URLs, however, users may be
        annoyed by <command>ssh</command> repeatedly asking for a
        password for every outbound connection.  The solution is to
        use a separate SSH password-caching tool such as
        <command>ssh-agent</command> on a Unix-like system, or
        <command>pageant</command> on Windows.</para>

      <para>When running over a tunnel, authorization is primarily
        controlled by operating system permissions to the repository's
        database files; it's very much the same as if Harry were
        accessing the repository directly via a
        <literal>file://</literal> URL.  If multiple system users are
        going to be accessing the repository directly, you may want to
        place them into a common group, and you'll need to be careful
        about umasks (be sure to read <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/> later in this
        chapter).  But even in the case of tunneling, you can still use the
        <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file to block access, by
        simply setting <literal>auth-access = read</literal>
        or <literal>auth-access = none</literal>.
        <footnote>
          <para>Note that using any sort of
            <command>svnserve</command>-enforced access control at all
            is a bit pointless; the user already has direct access to
            the repository database.</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>You'd think that the story of SSH tunneling would end
        here, but it doesn't.  Subversion allows you to create custom
        tunnel behaviors in your runtime <filename>config</filename>
        file (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea"/>.)  For
        example, suppose you want to use RSH instead of SSH.
        <footnote>
          <para>We don't actually recommend this, since RSH
            is notably less secure than SSH.</para>
        </footnote>
        In the <literal>[tunnels]</literal> section of your
        <filename>config</filename> file, simply define it like
        this:</para>

      <screen>
[tunnels]
rsh = rsh
</screen>

      <para>And now, you can use this new tunnel definition by using a
        URL scheme that matches the name of your new variable:
        <literal>svn+rsh://host/path</literal>.  When using the new
        URL scheme, the Subversion client will actually be running the
        command <userinput>rsh host svnserve -t</userinput> behind the
        scenes.  If you include a username in the URL (e.g.,
        <literal>svn+rsh://username@host/path</literal>), the client
        will also include that in its command (<userinput>rsh
        username@host svnserve -t</userinput>).  But you can define new
        tunneling schemes to be much more clever than that:</para>

      <screen>
[tunnels]
joessh = $JOESSH /opt/alternate/ssh -p 29934
</screen>

      <para>This example demonstrates a couple of things.  First, it
        shows how to make the Subversion client launch a very specific
        tunneling binary (the one located at
        <filename>/opt/alternate/ssh</filename>) with specific
        options.  In this case, accessing an
        <literal>svn+joessh://</literal> URL would invoke the
        particular SSH binary with <option>-p 29934</option> as
        arguments&#x2014;useful if you want the tunnel program to
        connect to a nonstandard port.</para>

      <para>Second, it shows how to define a custom environment
        variable that can override the name of the tunneling program.
        Setting the <literal>SVN_SSH</literal> environment variable is
        a convenient way to override the default SSH tunnel agent.
        But if you need to have several different overrides for
        different servers, each perhaps contacting a different port or
        passing a different set of options to SSH, you can use the
        mechanism demonstrated in this example.  Now if we were to set
        the <literal>JOESSH</literal> environment variable, its value
        would override the entire value of the tunnel
        variable&#x2014;<command>$JOESSH</command> would be executed
        instead of <userinput>/opt/alternate/ssh -p
        29934</userinput>.</para>

        <title>Initial setup</title>

        <para>To begin, locate the home directory of the account
          you'll be using to launch <command>svnserve</command>.  Make
          sure the account has an SSH public/private keypair
          installed, and that the user can log in via public-key
          authentication.  Password authentication will not work,
          since all of the following SSH tricks revolve around using
          the SSH <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file.</para>

        <para>If it doesn't already exist, create the
          <filename>authorized_keys</filename> file (on Unix,
          typically <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>).
          Each line in this file describes a public key that is
          allowed to connect.  The lines are typically of the
          form:</para>

        <screen>
  ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch&#x2026; user@example.com
</screen>

        <para>The first field describes the type of key, the second
          field is the base64-encoded key itself, and the third field
          is a comment.  However, it's a lesser known fact that the
          entire line can be preceded by a <literal>command</literal>
          field:</para>

        <screen>
  command="program" ssh-dsa AAAABtce9euch&#x2026; user@example.com
</screen>

        <para>When the <literal>command</literal> field is set, the
          SSH daemon will run the named program instead of the
          typical tunnel-mode <command>svnserve</command> invocation that the
          Subversion client asks for.  This opens the door to a number
          of server-side tricks.  In the following examples, we
          abbreviate the lines of the file as:</para>

        <screen>
  command="program" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</screen>

      </sect3>

      <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.svnserve.sshtricks.fixedcmd">
        <title>Controlling the invoked command</title>

        <para>Because we can specify the executed server-side command,
          it's easy to name a specific <command>svnserve</command>
          binary to run and to pass it extra arguments:</para>

        <screen>
  command="/path/to/svnserve -t -r /virtual/root" TYPE KEY COMMENT
</screen>

        <para>In this example, <filename>/path/to/svnserve</filename>
          might be a custom wrapper script
          around <command>svnserve</command> which sets the umask (see
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.multimethod"/>.)  It also
          shows how to anchor <command>svnserve</command> in a virtual
          root directory, just as one often does when
          running <command>svnserve</command> as a daemon process.
          This might be done either to restrict access to parts of the
          system, or simply to relieve the user of having to type an
          absolute path in the <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>
          URL.</para>

        <para>It's also possible to have multiple users share a single
          account.  Instead of creating a separate system account for
          each user, generate a public/private key pair for each
          person.  Then place each public key into
          the <filename>authorized_users</filename> file, one per
          line, and use the <option>--tunnel-user</option>
          option:</para>

        <screen>
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry" TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=sally" TYPE2 KEY2 sally@example.com
</screen>

        <para>This example allows both Harry and Sally to connect to
          the same account via public key authentication.  Each of
          them has a custom command that will be executed;
          the <option>--tunnel-user</option> option 
          tells <command>svnserve</command> to assume that the named
          argument is the authenticated user.  Without
          <option>--tunnel-user</option>, it would appear as though
          all commits were coming from the one shared system
          account.</para>

        <para>A final word of caution: giving a user access to the
          server via public-key in a shared account might still allow
          other forms of SSH access, even if you've set
          the <literal>command</literal> value
          in <filename>authorized_keys</filename>.  For example, the
          user may still get shell access through SSH or be able to
          perform X11 or general port forwarding through your server.
          To give the user as little permission as possible, you may
          want to specify a number of restrictive options immediately
          after the <literal>command</literal>:</para>

        <screen>
  command="svnserve -t --tunnel-user=harry",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forw
arding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty TYPE1 KEY1 harry@example.com
</screen>

        <para>Note that this all must be on one line&#x2014;truly on
          one line&#x2014;since SSH <filename>authorized_keys</filename> 
          files do not even allow the conventional backslash character
          (<literal>\</literal>) for line continuation.  The only
          reason we've shown it with a line break is to fit it on
          the physical page of a book.</para>

    <title>httpd, the Apache HTTP Server</title>

    <para>The Apache HTTP Server is a <quote>heavy-duty</quote>
      network server that Subversion can leverage.  Via a custom
      module, <command>httpd</command> makes Subversion repositories
      available to clients via the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an
      extension to HTTP 1.1 (see <ulink url="http://www.webdav.org/"/>
      for more information).  This protocol takes the ubiquitous HTTP
      protocol that is the core of the World Wide Web, and adds
      writing&#x2014;specifically, versioned
      writing&#x2014;capabilities.  The result is a standardized,
      robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
      Apache 2.0 software, supported by numerous operating systems
      and third-party products, and doesn't require network
      administrators to open up yet another custom port.
      <footnote>
        <para>They really hate doing that.</para>
      </footnote>
      While an Apache-Subversion server has more features than
      <command>svnserve</command>, it's also a bit more difficult
      to set up.  With flexibility often comes more complexity.</para>

    <para>Much of the following discussion includes references to
      Apache configuration directives.  While some examples are given
      of the use of these directives, describing them in full is
      outside the scope of this chapter.  The Apache team maintains
      excellent documentation, publicly available on their web site at
      <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org"/>.  For example, a general
      reference for the configuration directives is located at
      <ulink url="       http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html"/>.</para>

    <para>Also, as you make changes to your Apache setup, it is likely
      that somewhere along the way a mistake will be made.  If you are
      not already familiar with Apache's logging subsystem, you should
      become aware of it.  In your <filename>httpd.conf</filename>
      file are directives that specify the on-disk locations of the
      access and error logs generated by Apache (the
      <literal>CustomLog</literal> and <literal>ErrorLog</literal>
      directives, respectively).
      Subversion's <command>mod_dav_svn</command> uses Apache's error
      logging interface as well.  You can always browse the contents
      of those files for information that might reveal the source of a
      problem that is not clearly noticeable otherwise.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Why Apache 2?</title>

      <para>If you're a system administrator, it's very likely that
        you're already running the Apache web server and have some
        prior experience with it.  At the time of this writing, Apache 1.3
        is the more popular version of Apache.  The world has
        been somewhat slow to upgrade to the Apache 2.x series for
        various reasons: some people fear change, especially changing
        something as critical as a web server.  Other people depend on
        plug-in modules that work only against the Apache 1.3 API, and
        they are waiting for a 2.x port.  Whatever the reason, many
        people begin to worry when they first discover that
        Subversion's Apache module is written specifically for the
        Apache 2 API.</para>

      <para>The proper response to this problem is: don't worry about
        it.  It's easy to run Apache 1.3 and Apache 2 side by side;
        simply install them to separate places and use Apache 2 as a
        dedicated Subversion server that runs on a port other than 80.
        Clients can access the repository by placing the port number
        into the URL:</para>

      <title>Prerequisites</title>

      <para>To network your repository over HTTP, you basically need
        four components, available in two packages.  You'll need
        Apache <command>httpd</command> 2.0, the
        <command>mod_dav</command> DAV module that comes with it,
        Subversion, and the <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
        filesystem provider module distributed with Subversion.
        Once you have all of those components, the process of
        networking your repository is as simple as:</para>

        <listitem>

      <para>You can accomplish the first two items either by
        compiling <command>httpd</command> and Subversion from
        source code or by installing prebuilt binary packages of
        them on your system.  For the most up-to-date information on
        how to compile Subversion for use with the Apache HTTP Server,
        as well as how to compile and configure Apache itself for
        this purpose, see the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file in
        the top level of the Subversion source code tree.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.basic">
      <title>Basic Apache Configuration</title>

      <para>Once you have all the necessary components installed on
        your system, all that remains is the configuration of Apache
        via its <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file.  Instruct Apache
        to load the <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module using the
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive.  This directive must
        precede any other Subversion-related configuration items.  If
        your Apache was installed using the default layout, your
        <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module should have been
        installed in the <filename>modules</filename> subdirectory of
        the Apache install location (often
        <filename>/usr/local/apache2</filename>).  The
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> directive has a simple syntax,
        mapping a named module to the location of a shared library on
        disk:</para>

        <screen>
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</screen>

      <para>Note that if <command>mod_dav</command> was compiled as a
        shared object (instead of statically linked directly to the
        <command>httpd</command> binary), you'll need a similar
        <literal>LoadModule</literal> statement for it, too.  Be sure
        that it comes before the <command>mod_dav_svn</command> line:</para>

        <screen>
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</screen>


      <para>At a later location in your configuration file, you now
        need to tell Apache where you keep your Subversion repository
        (or repositories).  The <literal>Location</literal> directive
        has an XML-like notation, starting with an opening tag and
        ending with a closing tag, with various other configuration
        directives in the middle.  The purpose of the
        <literal>Location</literal> directive is to instruct Apache to
        do something special when handling requests that are directed
        at a given URL or one of its children.  In the case of
        Subversion, you want Apache to simply hand off support for
        URLs that point at versioned resources to the DAV layer.  You
        can instruct Apache to delegate the handling of all URLs whose
        path portions (the part of the URL that follows the server's
        name and the optional port number) begin with
        <filename>/repos/</filename> to a DAV provider whose
        repository is located at
        <filename>/var/svn/repository</filename> using the
        following <filename>httpd.conf</filename> syntax:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

      <para>If you plan to support multiple Subversion repositories
        that will reside in the same parent directory on your local
        disk, you can use an alternative
        directive&#x2014;<literal>SVNParentPath</literal>&#x2014;to
        indicate that common parent directory.  For example, if you
        know you will be creating multiple Subversion repositories in
        a directory <filename>/var/svn</filename> that would be
        accessed via URLs such as
        <uri>http://my.server.com/svn/repos1</uri>,
        <uri>http://my.server.com/svn/repos2</uri>, and so on, you
        could use the <filename>httpd.conf</filename> configuration
        syntax in the following example:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn

  # any "/svn/foo" URL will map to a repository /var/svn/foo
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

      <para>Using the previous syntax, Apache will delegate the
        handling of all URLs whose path portions begin with
        <filename>/svn/</filename> to the Subversion DAV provider,
        which will then assume that any items in the directory
        specified by the <literal>SVNParentPath</literal> directive
        are actually Subversion repositories.  This is a particularly
        convenient syntax in that, unlike the use of the
        <literal>SVNPath</literal> directive, you don't have to
        restart Apache to create and network new repositories.</para>

      <para>Be sure that when you define your new
        <literal>Location</literal>, it doesn't overlap with other
        exported locations.  For example, if your main
        <literal>DocumentRoot</literal> is exported to
        <filename>/www</filename>, do not export a Subversion
        repository in <literal>&lt;Location /www/repos&gt;</literal>.
        If a request comes in for the URI
        <filename>/www/repos/foo.c</filename>, Apache won't know
        whether to look for a file <filename>repos/foo.c</filename> in
        the <literal>DocumentRoot</literal>, or whether to delegate
        <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to return
        <filename>foo.c</filename> from the Subversion repository.
        The result is often an error from the server of the form
        <literal>301 Moved Permanently</literal>.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Server Names and the COPY Request</title>

        <para>Subversion makes use of the <literal>COPY</literal>
          request type to perform server-side copies of files and
          directories.  As part of the sanity checking done by the
          Apache modules, the source of the copy is expected to be
          located on the same machine as the destination of the copy.
          To satisfy this requirement, you might need to
          tell <command>mod_dav</command> the name you use as the
          hostname of your server.  Generally, you can use
          the <literal>ServerName</literal> directive in
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename> to accomplish this.</para>

        <screen>
ServerName svn.example.com
</screen>

        <para>If you are using Apache's virtual hosting support via
          the <literal>NameVirtualHost</literal> directive, you may
          need to use the <literal>ServerAlias</literal> directive to
          specify additional names by which your server is known.
          Again, refer to the Apache documentation for full
          details.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>At this stage, you should strongly consider the question
        of permissions.  If you've been running Apache for some time
        now as your regular web server, you probably already have a
        collection of content&#x2014;web pages, scripts, and such.
        These items have already been configured with a set of
        permissions that allows them to work with Apache, or more
        appropriately, that allows Apache to work with those files.
        Apache, when used as a Subversion server, will also need the
        correct permissions to read and write to your Subversion
        repository.</para>

      <para>You will need to determine a permission system setup that
        satisfies Subversion's requirements without messing up any
        previously existing web page or script installations.  This
        might mean changing the permissions on your Subversion
        repository to match those in use by other things that Apache
        serves for you, or it could mean using the
        <literal>User</literal> and <literal>Group</literal>
        directives in <filename>httpd.conf</filename> to specify that
        Apache should run as the user and group that owns your
        Subversion repository.  There is no single correct way to set
        up your permissions, and each administrator will have
        different reasons for doing things a certain way.  Just be
        aware that permission-related problems are perhaps the most
        common oversight when configuring a Subversion repository for
        use with Apache.</para>

        <para>The easiest way to authenticate a client is via the

          username and password to verify that a user is who she says

        <para>Next, you need to add some more

          specify the <literal>Basic</literal> authentication system.
          <literal>AuthName</literal> is an arbitrary name that you
          give for the authentication domain.  Most browsers will
          display this name in the pop-up dialog box when the browser
          is querying the user for her name and password.  Finally,
          use the <literal>AuthUserFile</literal> directive to specify
          the location of the password file you created using
          <command>htpasswd</command>.</para>

        <para>After adding these three directives, your
          <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block should look
          something like this:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

        <para>This <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block is not
          yet complete, and it will not do anything useful.  It's
          merely telling Apache that whenever authorization is
          required, Apache should harvest a username and password from
          the Subversion client.  What's missing here, however, are
          directives that tell Apache <emphasis>which</emphasis> sorts
          of client requests require authorization.  Wherever
          authorization is required, Apache will demand authentication
          as well.  The simplest thing to do is protect all requests.
          Adding <literal>Require valid-user</literal> tells Apache
          that all requests require an authenticated user:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

        <para>Be sure to read the next section (<xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz"/>) for more detail on the
          <literal>Require</literal> directive and other ways to set
          authorization policies.</para>

        <para>One word of warning: HTTP Basic Auth passwords pass in
          very nearly plain text over the network, and thus are
          extremely insecure.</para>

        <para>Another option is to not use Basic authentication, but to
          use Digest authentication instead.  Digest authentication
          allows the server to verify the client's
          identity <emphasis>without</emphasis> passing the plain-text
          password over the network.  Assuming that the client and
          server both know the user's password, they can verify that
          the password is the same by using it to apply a hashing
          function to a one-time bit of information.  The server sends
          a small random-ish string to the client; the client uses the
          user's password to hash the string; the server then looks to
          see whether the hashed value is what it expected.</para>

        <para>Configuring Apache for Digest authentication is also
          fairly easy, and only a small variation on our prior
          example.  Be sure to consult Apache's documentation for full
          details.</para>

&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

        <para>If you're looking for maximum security, public key
          cryptography is the best solution.  It may be best to use
          some sort of SSL encryption, so that clients authenticate
          via <literal>https://</literal> instead
          of <literal>http://</literal>; at a bare minimum, you can
          configure Apache to use a self-signed server certificate.
          <footnote>
            <para>While self-signed server certificates are still
              vulnerable to a <quote>man-in-the-middle</quote> attack,
              such an attack is much more difficult for a casual
              observer to pull off, compared to sniffing unprotected
              passwords.</para>

        <para>If a Subversion client is compiled to use OpenSSL,

          the Subversion client is not only able to verify server
          certificates, but can also supply client certificates when
          challenged.  When the client and server have exchanged SSL
          certificates and successfully authenticated one another, all
          further communication is encrypted via a session key.</para>

        <para>It's beyond the scope of this book to describe how to
          generate client and server certificates and how to
          configure Apache to use them.  Many other books, including
          Apache's own documentation, describe this task.  But what we
          <emphasis>can</emphasis> cover here is how to manage
          server and client certificates from an ordinary Subversion
          client.</para>

        <para>When speaking to Apache via <literal>https://</literal>,
          a Subversion client can receive two different types of
          information:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem><para>A server certificate</para></listitem>
          <listitem><para>A demand for a client certificate</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>If the client receives a server certificate, it needs to
          verify that it trusts the certificate: is the server really
          who it claims to be?  The OpenSSL library does this by
          examining the signer of the server certificate, or
          <firstterm>certificate authority</firstterm> (CA).  If
          OpenSSL is unable to automatically trust the CA, or if some
          other problem occurs (such as an expired certificate or
          hostname mismatch), the Subversion command-line client will
          ask you whether you want to trust the server certificate
          anyway:</para>

</screen>

        <para>This dialogue should look familiar; it's essentially the
          same question you've probably seen coming from your web
          browser (which is just another HTTP client like Subversion).
          If you choose the <literal>(p)</literal>ermanent option, the server certificate
          will be cached in your private runtime
          <filename>auth/</filename> area in just the same way your
          username and password are cached (see <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"/>).  If cached,
          Subversion will automatically trust this certificate
          in future negotiations.</para>

        <para>Your runtime <filename>servers</filename> file also gives
          you the ability to make your Subversion client automatically
          trust specific CAs, either globally or on a per-host basis.
          Simply set the <literal>ssl-authority-files</literal>
          variable to a semicolon-separated list of PEM-encoded CA
          certificates:</para>

        <screen>
[global]
ssl-authority-files = /path/to/CAcert1.pem;/path/to/CAcert2.pem
</screen>

        <para>Many OpenSSL installations also have a predefined set
          of <quote>default</quote> CAs that are nearly universally
          trusted.  To make the Subversion client automatically trust
          these standard authorities, set the
          <literal>ssl-trust-default-ca</literal> variable to
          <literal>true</literal>.</para>

        <para>When talking to Apache, a Subversion client might also
          receive a challenge for a client certificate.  Apache is
          asking the client to identify itself: is the client really
          who it says it is?  If all goes correctly, the Subversion
          client sends back a private certificate signed by a CA that
          Apache trusts.  A client certificate is usually stored on
          disk in encrypted format, protected by a local password.
          When Subversion receives this challenge, it will ask you for
          a path to the certificate and the password that
          protects it:</para>

        <screen>
$ svn list https://host.example.com/repos/project

Authentication realm: https://host.example.com:443
Client certificate filename: /path/to/my/cert.p12
Passphrase for '/path/to/my/cert.p12':  ********
&#x2026;
</screen>

        <para>Notice that the client certificate is a
          <quote>p12</quote> file.  To use a client certificate with
          Subversion, it must be in PKCS#12 format, which is a
          portable standard.  Most web browsers are already able to
          import and export certificates in that format.   Another
          option is to use the OpenSSL command-line tools to convert
          existing certificates into PKCS#12.</para>

        <para>Again, the runtime <filename>servers</filename> file
          allows you to automate this challenge on a per-host basis.
          Either or both pieces of information can be described in
          runtime variables:</para>

        <screen>
[groups]
examplehost = host.example.com

[examplehost]
ssl-client-cert-file = /path/to/my/cert.p12
ssl-client-cert-password = somepassword
</screen>

        <para>Once you've set the
          <literal>ssl-client-cert-file</literal> and
          <literal>ssl-client-cert-password</literal> variables, the
          Subversion client can automatically respond to a client
          certificate challenge without prompting you.
          <footnote>
            <para>More security-conscious folk might not want to store
              the client certificate password in the runtime
              <filename>servers</filename> file.</para>

      <title>Authorization Options</title>

      <para>At this point, you've configured authentication, but not
        authorization.  Apache is able to challenge clients and
        confirm identities, but it has not been told how to allow or
        restrict access to the clients bearing those identities.  This
        section describes two strategies for controlling access to
        your repositories.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.blanket">
        <title>Blanket access control</title>

        <para>The simplest form of access control is to authorize
          certain users for either read-only access to a repository or
          read/write access to a repository.</para>

        <para>You can restrict access on all repository operations by
          adding the <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directive
          to your <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block.  Using
          our previous example, this would mean that only clients that
          claimed to be either <literal>harry</literal> or
          <literal>sally</literal> and that provided the correct
          password for their respective username would be allowed to
          do anything with the Subversion repository:</para>

        <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file

  # only authenticated users may access the repository
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

        <para>Sometimes you don't need to run such a tight ship.  For
          example, Subversion's own source code repository at
          <ulink url="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn"/> allows anyone
          in the world to perform read-only repository tasks (such as
          checking out working copies and browsing the repository with
          a web browser), but restricts all write operations to
          authenticated users.  To do this type of selective
          restriction, you can use the <literal>Limit</literal> and
          <literal>LimitExcept</literal> configuration directives.
          Like the <literal>Location</literal> directive, these blocks
          have starting and ending tags, and you would nest them
          inside your <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal>
          block.</para>

        <para>The parameters present on the <literal>Limit</literal>
          and <literal>LimitExcept</literal> directives are HTTP
          request types that are affected by that block.  For example,
          if you wanted to disallow all access to your repository
          except the currently supported read-only operations, you
          would use the <literal>LimitExcept</literal> directive,
          passing the <literal>GET</literal>,
          <literal>PROPFIND</literal>, <literal>OPTIONS</literal>, and
          <literal>REPORT</literal> request type parameters.  Then the
          previously mentioned <literal>Require valid-user</literal>
          directive would be placed inside the
          <literal>&lt;LimitExcept&gt;</literal> block instead of just
          inside the <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block.</para>

        <para>These are only a few simple examples.  For more in-depth
          information about Apache access control and the

          <literal>Security</literal> section of the Apache

        <para>It's possible to set up finer-grained permissions using
          a second Apache httpd module,
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command>.  This module grabs the
          various opaque URLs passing from client to server, asks
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to decode them, and then
          possibly vetoes requests based on access policies defined in
          a configuration file.</para>

        <para>If you've built Subversion from source code,
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> is automatically built
          and installed alongside <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.
          Many binary distributions install it automatically as well.
          To verify that it's installed correctly, make sure it comes

LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so
</screen>

        <para>To activate this module, you need to configure your
          <literal>Location</literal> block to use the
          <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> directive, which
          specifies a file containing the permissions policy for paths
          within your repositories.  (In a moment, we'll discuss the
          format of that file.)</para>

        <para>Apache is flexible, so you have the option to configure
          your block in one of three general patterns.  To begin,
          choose one of these basic configuration patterns.  (The
          following examples are very simple; look at Apache's own
          documentation for much more detail on Apache authentication
          and authorization options.)</para>

        <para>The simplest block is to allow open access to everyone.
          In this scenario, Apache never sends authentication
          challenges, so all users are treated as
          <quote>anonymous.</quote> (See
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1"/>.)</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1">

  # our access control policy
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
          </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>On the opposite end of the paranoia scale, you can
          configure your block to demand authentication from everyone.
          All clients must supply credentials to identify themselves.
          Your block unconditionally requires authentication via the
          <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directive, and it
          defines a means to authenticate.  (See
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2"/>.)</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2">

  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /path/to/users/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
          </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>A third very popular pattern is to allow a combination
          of authenticated and anonymous access.  For example, many
          administrators want to allow anonymous users to read certain
          repository directories, but want only authenticated users to
          read (or write) more sensitive areas.  In this setup, all
          users start out accessing the repository anonymously.  If
          your access control policy demands a real username at any
          point, Apache will demand authentication from the client.
          To do this, use both the <literal>Satisfy Any</literal>
          and <literal>Require valid-user</literal> directives
          together.  (See
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3"/>.)</para>

        <example id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3">

            authenticated/anonymous access</title>

&lt;/Location&gt;

        </example>

        <para>Once you've settled on one of these three
          basic <filename>httpd.conf</filename> templates, you need to
          create your file containing access rules for particular
          paths within the repository.  We describe this later in
          this chapter, in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz"/>.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff">
        <title>Disabling path-based checks</title>

        <para>The <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module goes through a
          lot of work to make sure that data you've marked
          <quote>unreadable</quote> doesn't get accidentally leaked.
          This means it needs to closely monitor all of the paths
          and file-contents returned by commands such as <command>svn
          checkout</command> and <command>svn update</command>.
          If these commands encounter a path that isn't
          readable according to some authorization policy, the
          path is typically omitted altogether.  In the case of
          history or rename tracing&#x2014;for example, running a command such
          as <userinput>svn cat -r OLD foo.c</userinput> on a file that
          was renamed long ago&#x2014;the rename tracking will simply
          halt if one of the object's former names is determined to be
          read-restricted.</para>

        <para>All of this path checking can sometimes be quite
          expensive, especially in the case of <command>svn

          server looks at every changed path in each revision and
          checks it for readability.  If an unreadable path is
          discovered, it's omitted from the list of the
          revision's changed paths (normally seen with
          the <option>--verbose</option> option), and the whole log
          message is suppressed.  Needless to say, this can be
          time-consuming on revisions that affect a large number of
          files.  This is the cost of security: even if you haven't
          configured a module such as
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> at all, the
          <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module is still asking Apache
          <command>httpd</command> to run authorization checks on
          every path.  The <command>mod_dav_svn</command> module has
          no idea what authorization modules have been installed, so
          all it can do is ask Apache to invoke whatever might be
          present.</para>

        <para>On the other hand, there's also an escape hatch of
          sorts, which allows you to trade security features for
          speed.  If you're not enforcing any sort of per-directory
          authorization (i.e., not using
          <command>mod_authz_svn</command> or similar module),
          you can disable all of this path checking.  In your
          <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file, use the
          <literal>SVNPathAuthz</literal> directive as shown in
          <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff.ex-1"/>.

        <title>Repository browsing</title>

        <para>One of the most useful benefits of an Apache/WebDAV
          configuration for your Subversion repository is that the
          youngest revisions of your versioned files and directories
          are immediately available for viewing via a regular web
          browser.  Since Subversion uses URLs to identify versioned
          resources, those URLs used for HTTP-based repository access
          can be typed directly into a web browser.  Your browser will
          issue an HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request for that URL;
          based on whether that URL represents a versioned directory
          or file, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> will respond with a
          directory listing or with file contents.</para>

        <para>Since the URLs do not contain any information about
          which version of the resource you wish to
          see, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> will always answer with
          the youngest version.  This functionality has the wonderful
          side effect that you can pass around Subversion URLs to your
          peers as references to documents, and those URLs will always
          point at the latest manifestation of that document.  Of
          course, you can even use the URLs as hyperlinks from other
          web sites, too.</para>

        <sidebar>
          <title>Can I View Older Revisions?</title>

          <para>With an ordinary web browser?  In one word: nope.  At
            least, not with <command>mod_dav_svn</command> as your
            only tool.</para>

          <para>Your web browser speaks ordinary HTTP only.  That
            means it knows only how to GET public URLs, which
            represent the latest versions of files and directories.
            According to the WebDAV/DeltaV specification, each server
            defines a private URL syntax for older versions of
            resources, and that syntax is opaque to clients.  To find
            an older version of a file, a client must follow a
            specific procedure to <quote>discover</quote> the proper
            URL; the procedure involves issuing a series of WebDAV
            PROPFIND requests and understanding DeltaV concepts.  This
            is something your web browser simply can't do.</para>

          <para>So, to answer the question, one obvious way to see
            older revisions of files and directories is by passing the
            <option>--revision</option> (<option>-r</option>) argument
            to the <command>svn list</command> and <command>svn
            cat</command> commands.  To browse old revisions with your
            web browser, however, you can use third-party software.  A
            good example of this is ViewVC (<ulink url="http://viewvc.tigris.org/"/>).  ViewVC was originally
            written to display CVS repositories through the Web,
            <footnote>
              <para>Back then, it was called ViewCVS.</para>
            </footnote>
            and the latest releases are able to understand Subversion
            repositories as well.</para>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.mimetype">
          <title>Proper MIME type</title>

          <para>When browsing a Subversion repository, the web browser
            gets a clue about how to render a file's contents by
            looking at the <literal>Content-Type:</literal> header
            returned in Apache's response to the
            HTTP <literal>GET</literal> request.  The value of this
            header is some sort of MIME type.  By default, Apache will
            tell the web browsers that all repository files are of
            the <quote>default</quote> MIME type,
            typically <literal>text/plain</literal>.  This can be
            frustrating, however, if a user wishes repository files to
            render as something more meaningful&#x2014;for example,
            it might be nice to have a <filename>foo.html</filename> file
            in the repository actually render as HTML when
            browsing.</para>

          <para>To make this happen, you need only to make sure that
            your files have the
            proper <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> set.  We discuss this 
            in more detail in
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"/>,
            and you can even configure your client to automatically
            attach proper <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> properties
            to files entering the repository for the first time; see
            <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.auto"/>.</para>

          <para>So in our example, if one were to set
          the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property
          to <literal>text/html</literal> on
          file <filename>foo.html</filename>, Apache would
          properly tell your web browser to render the file as HTML.
          One could also attach proper <literal>image/*</literal>
          MIME-type properties to image files and ultimately get an
          entire web site to be viewable directly from a repository!
          There's generally no problem with this, as long as the web
          site doesn't contain any dynamically generated
          content.</para>

          <para>You generally will get more use out of URLs to
            versioned files&#x2014;after all, that's where the
            interesting content tends to lie.  But you might have
            occasion to browse a Subversion directory listing, where
            you'll quickly note that the generated HTML used to
            display that listing is very basic, and certainly not
            intended to be aesthetically pleasing (or even
            interesting).  To enable customization of these directory
            displays, Subversion provides an XML index feature.  A
            single <literal>SVNIndexXSLT</literal> directive in your
            repository's <literal>Location</literal> block of
            <filename>httpd.conf</filename> will
            instruct <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to generate XML

         <para>Using the <literal>SVNIndexXSLT</literal> directive and
           a creative XSLT stylesheet, you can make your directory
           listings match the color schemes and imagery used in other

           the sample stylesheets provided in the Subversion source
           distribution's <filename>tools/xslt/</filename> directory.
           Keep in mind that the path provided to the

        <title>Apache logging</title>

        <para>Because Apache is an HTTP server at heart, it contains
          fantastically flexible logging features.  It's beyond the
          scope of this book to discuss all of the ways logging can be
          configured, but we should point out that even the most
          generic <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file will cause
          Apache to produce two logs:
          <filename>error_log</filename>
          and <filename>access_log</filename>.  These logs may appear
          in different places, but are typically created in the
          logging area of your Apache installation.  (On Unix, they
          often live
          in <filename>/usr/local/apache2/logs/</filename>.)</para>

        <para>The <filename>error_log</filename> describes any internal
          errors that Apache runs into as it works.
          The <filename>access_log</filename> file records every
          incoming HTTP request received by Apache.  This makes it
          easy to see, for example, which IP addresses Subversion
          clients are coming from, how often particular clients use
          the server, which users are authenticating properly, and
          which requests succeed or fail.</para>

        <para>Unfortunately, because HTTP is a stateless protocol,
          even the simplest Subversion client operation generates
          multiple network requests.  It's very difficult to look at
          the <filename>access_log</filename> and deduce what the
          client was doing&#x2014;most operations look like a series
          of cryptic <literal>PROPPATCH</literal>, <literal>GET</literal>,
          <literal>PUT</literal>, and <literal>REPORT</literal>
          requests.  To make things worse, many client operations send
          nearly identical series of requests, so it's even harder to
          tell them apart.</para>

        <para><command>mod_dav_svn</command>, however, can come to
          your aid.  By activating an <quote>operational
          logging</quote> feature, you can
          ask <command>mod_dav_svn</command> to create a separate log
          file describing what sort of high-level operations your
          clients are performing.</para>

        <para>To do this, you need to make use of
          Apache's <literal>CustomLog</literal> directive (which is
          explained in more detail in Apache's own documentation).
          Be sure to invoke this
          directive <emphasis>outside</emphasis> your
          Subversion <literal>Location</literal> block:</para>

&lt;/Location&gt;

CustomLog logs/svn_logfile "%t %u %{SVN-ACTION}e" env=SVN-ACTION
</screen>

        <para>In this example, we're asking Apache to create a special
          logfile, <filename>svn_logfile</filename>, in the standard
          Apache <filename>logs</filename> directory.
          The <literal>%t</literal> and <literal>%u</literal>
          variables are replaced by the time and username of the
          request, respectively.  The really important parts are the
          two instances of <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal>.
          When Apache sees that variable, it substitutes the value of
          the <literal>SVN-ACTION</literal> environment variable,
          which is automatically set by <command>mod_dav_svn</command>
          whenever it detects a high-level client action.</para>

        <para>So, instead of having to interpret a

        <title>Write-through proxying</title>

        <para>One of the nice advantages of using Apache as a
          Subversion server is that it can be set up for simple
          replication.  For example, suppose that your team is
          distributed across four offices around the globe.  The
          Subversion repository can exist only in one of those
          offices, which means the other three offices will not enjoy
          accessing it&#x2014;they're likely to experience
          significantly slower traffic and response times when
          updating and committing code.  A powerful solution is to set
          up a system consisting of one <firstterm>master</firstterm>
          Apache server and several <firstterm>slave</firstterm>
          Apache servers.  If you place a slave server in each office,
          users can check out a working copy from whichever slave
          is closest to them.  All read requests go to their local
          slave.  Write requests get automatically routed to the
          single master server.  When the commit completes, the master
          then automatically <quote>pushes</quote> the new revision to
          each slave server using the <command>svnsync</command>
          replication tool.</para>

        <para>This configuration creates a huge perceptual speed
          increase for your users, because Subversion client traffic
          is typically 80&#x2013;90% read requests.  And if those
          requests are coming from a <emphasis>local</emphasis>
          server, it's a huge win.</para>

        <para>In this section, we'll walk you through a standard setup
          of this single-master/multiple-slave system.  However, keep
          in mind that your servers must be running at least Apache
          2.2.0 (with <command>mod_proxy</command> loaded) and
          Subversion 1.5 (<command>mod_dav_svn</command>).</para>

        <sect4 id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.writethruproxy.configure">
          <title>Configure the servers</title>

          <para>First, configure your master server's
            <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file in the usual way.
            Make the repository available at a certain URI location,
            and configure authentication and authorization however
            you'd like.  After that's done, configure each of your
            <quote>slave</quote> servers in the exact same way, but
            add the special <literal>SVNMasterURI</literal> directive
            to the block:</para>

          <screen>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  SVNMasterURI http://master.example.com/svn
  &#x2026;
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

          <para>This new directive tells a slave server to redirect
            all write requests to the master.  (This is done
            automatically via Apache's <command>mod_proxy</command>
            module.)  Ordinary read requests, however, are still
            serviced by the slaves.  Be sure that your master and
            slave servers all have matching authentication and
            authorization configurations;  if they fall out of sync,
            it can lead to big headaches.</para>

          <para>Next, we need to deal with the problem of infinite
            recursion.  With the current configuration, imagine what
            will happen when a Subversion client performs a commit to
            the master server.  After the commit completes, the server
            uses <command>svnsync</command> to replicate the new
            revision to each slave.  But because
            <command>svnsync</command> appears to be just another
            Subversion client performing a commit, the slave will
            immediately attempt to proxy the incoming write request
            back to the master!  Hilarity ensues.</para>

          <para>The solution to this problem is to have the master
            push revisions to a different
            <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> on the slaves.  This
            location is configured to <emphasis>not</emphasis> proxy
            write requests at all, but to accept normal commits from
            (and only from) the master's IP address:</para>

          <title>Set up replication</title>

          <para>Now that you've configured
            your <literal>Location</literal> blocks on master and
            slaves, you need to configure the master to replicate to
            the slaves.  This is done the usual way&#x2014;
            using <command>svnsync</command>.  If you're not familiar
            with this tool, see
            <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.maint.replication"/> for
            details.</para>

          <para>First, make sure that each slave repository has a
            <filename>pre-revprop-change</filename> hook script which
            allows remote revision property changes.  (This is
            standard procedure for being on the receiving end of
            <command>svnsync</command>.) Then log into the master
            server and configure each of the slave repository URIs to
            receive data from the master repository on the local
            disk:</para>

          <para>After this is done, we configure the master server's
            <literal>post-commit</literal> hook script to invoke

</programlisting>

          <para>The extra bits on the end of each line aren't
            necessary, but they're a sneaky way to allow the sync
            commands to run in the background so that the Subversion
            client isn't left waiting forever for the commit to
            finish.  In addition to this
            <literal>post-commit</literal> hook, you'll need a
            <literal>post-revprop-change</literal> hook as well so
            that when a user, say, modifies a log message, the slave

          <para>The only thing we've left out here is what to do about
            locks.  Because locks are strictly enforced by the master
            server (the only place where commits happen), we don't
            technically need to do anything.  Many teams don't use
            Subversion's locking features at all, so it may be a
            nonissue for you.  However, if lock changes aren't
            replicated from master to slaves, it means that clients
            won't be able to query the status of locks
            (e.g., <userinput>svn status -u</userinput> will show no
            information about repository locks).  If this bothers you,
            you can write <literal>post-lock</literal> and
            <literal>post-unlock</literal> hook scripts that run
            <command>svn lock</command> and <command>svn
            unlock</command> on each slave machine, presumably through
            a remote shell method such as SSH.  That's left as an
            exercise for the reader!</para>

          <title>Caveats</title>

          <para>Your master/slave replication system should now be
            ready to use.  A couple of words of warning are in order,
            however.  Remember that this replication isn't entirely
            robust in the face of computer or network crashes.  For
            example, if one of the automated
            <command>svnsync</command> commands fails to complete for
            some reason, the slaves will begin to fall behind.  For
            example, your remote users will see that they've committed
            revision 100, but then when they run <command>svn
            update</command>, their local server will tell them that
            revision 100 doesn't yet exist!  Of course, the problem
            will be automatically fixed the next time another commit
            happens and the subsequent <command>svnsync</command> is
            successful&#x2014;the sync will replicate all waiting
            revisions.  But still, you may want to set up some sort of
            out-of-band monitoring to notice synchronization failures
            and force <command>svnsync</command> to run when things go
            wrong.</para>

            <title>Can We Set Up Replication with svnserve?</title>

            <para>If you're using <command>svnserve</command> instead
              of Apache as your server, you can certainly configure
              your repository's hook scripts to invoke
              <command>svnsync</command> as we've shown here, thereby
              causing automatic replication from master to slaves.
              Unfortunately, at the time of this writing there is no way to
              make slave <command>svnserve</command> servers
              automatically proxy write requests back to the master
              server.  This means your users would only be able to
              check out read-only working copies from the slave
              servers.  You'd have to configure your slave servers to
              disallow write access completely.  This might be useful
              for creating read-only <quote>mirrors</quote> of popular
              open source projects, but it's not a transparent
              proxying system.</para> </sidebar>

        <title>Other Apache features</title>

        <para>Several of the features already provided by Apache in
          its role as a robust web server can be leveraged for
          increased functionality or security in Subversion as well.
          The Subversion client is able to use SSL (the Secure Sockets
          Layer, discussed earlier).  If your Subversion client is
          built to support SSL, it can access your Apache server
          using <literal>https://</literal> and enjoy a high-quality
          encrypted network session.</para>

        <para>Equally useful are other features of the Apache and
          Subversion relationship, such as the ability to specify a
          custom port (instead of the default HTTP port 80) or a
          virtual domain name by which the Subversion repository
          should be accessed, or the ability to access the repository
          through an HTTP proxy.</para>

        <para>Finally, because <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is
          speaking a subset of the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, it's
          possible to access the repository via third-party DAV
          clients.  Most modern operating systems (Win32, OS X, and
          Linux) have the built-in ability to mount a DAV server as a
          standard network <quote>shared folder.</quote> This is a
          complicated topic, but also wondrous when implemented.  For
          details, read <xref linkend="svn.webdav"/>.</para>

        <para>Note that there are a number of other small tweaks one can
          make to <command>mod_dav_svn</command> that are too obscure
          to mention in this chapter.  For a complete list of

    <title>Path-Based Authorization</title>

    <para>Both Apache and <command>svnserve</command> are capable of
      granting (or denying) permissions to users.  Typically this is
      done over the entire repository: a user can read the repository
      (or not), and she can write to the repository (or not).  It's
      also possible, however, to define finer-grained access rules.
      One set of users may have permission to write to a certain
      directory in the repository, but not others; another directory
      might not even be readable by all but a few special
      people.</para>

    <para>Both servers use a common file format to describe these
      path-based access rules.  In the case of Apache, one needs to
      load the <command>mod_authz_svn</command> module and then add
      the <literal>AuthzSVNAccessFile</literal> directive (within
      the <filename>httpd.conf</filename> file) pointing to your own
      rules file.  (For a full explanation, see
      <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir"/>.)  If
      you're using <command>svnserve</command>, you need to make
      the <literal>authz-db</literal> variable
      (within <filename>svnserve.conf</filename>) point to your
      rules file.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>Do You Really Need Path-Based Access Control?</title>

      <para>A lot of administrators setting up Subversion for the
        first time tend to jump into path-based access control without
        giving it a lot of thought.  The administrator usually knows
        which teams of people are working on which projects, so it's
        easy to jump in and grant certain teams access to certain
        directories and not others.  It seems like a natural thing,
        and it appeases the administrator's desire to maintain tight
        control of the repository.</para>

      <para>Note, though, that there are often invisible (and
        visible!) costs associated with this feature.  In the visible
        category, the server needs to do a lot more work to ensure
        that the user has the right to read or write each specific
        path; in certain situations, there's very noticeable
        performance loss.  In the invisible category, consider the
        culture you're creating.  Most of the time, while certain
        users <emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> be committing changes to
        certain parts of the repository, that social contract doesn't
        need to be technologically enforced.  Teams can sometimes
        spontaneously collaborate with each other; someone may want to
        help someone else out by committing to an area she doesn't
        normally work on.  By preventing this sort of thing at the
        server level, you're setting up barriers to unexpected
        collaboration.  You're also creating a bunch of rules that
        need to be maintained as projects develop, new users are
        added, and so on.  It's a bunch of extra work to
        maintain.</para>

        <para>Remember that this is a version control system!  Even if
        somebody accidentally commits a change to something she
        shouldn't, it's easy to undo the change.  And if a user
        commits to the wrong place with deliberate malice, it's a
        social problem anyway, and that the problem needs to be dealt
        with outside Subversion.</para>

      <para>So, before you begin restricting users' access rights, ask
        yourself whether there's a real, honest need for this, or whether it's
        just something that <quote>sounds good</quote> to an
        administrator.  Decide whether it's worth sacrificing some
        server speed, and remember that there's very little risk
        involved; it's bad to become dependent on technology as a
        crutch for social problems.
        <footnote>
          <para>A common theme in this book!</para>
        </footnote>
      </para>

      <para>As an example to ponder, consider that the Subversion
        project itself has always had a notion of who is allowed to
        commit where, but it's always been enforced socially.  This is
        a good model of community trust, especially for open source
        projects.  Of course, sometimes there <emphasis>are</emphasis>
        truly legitimate needs for path-based access control; within
        corporations, for example, certain types of data really can be
        sensitive, and access needs to be genuinely restricted to
        small groups of people.</para>

    </sidebar>

    <para>Once your server knows where to find your rules file, it's
      time to define the rules.</para>

    <para>The syntax of the file is the same familiar one used
      by <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> and the runtime
      configuration files.  Lines that start with a hash
      (<literal>#</literal>) are ignored.  In its simplest form, each
      section names a repository and path within it, as well as the
      authenticated usernames are the option names within each
      section.  The value of each option describes the user's level of
      access to the repository path: either
      <literal>r</literal> (read-only) or <literal>rw</literal>
      (read/write).  If the user is not mentioned at all, no access is
      allowed.</para>

    <para>To be more specific: the value of the section names is
      either of the form <literal>[repos-name:path]</literal> or of the
      form <literal>[path]</literal>.  If you're using the
      <literal>SVNParentPath</literal> directive, it's important
      to specify the repository names in your sections.  If you omit
      them, a section such as
      <literal>[/some/dir]</literal> will match the path
      <filename>/some/dir</filename> in <emphasis>every</emphasis>
      repository.  If you're using the <literal>SVNPath</literal>
      directive, however, it's fine to only define paths in your
      sections&#x2014;after all, there's only one repository.</para>

    <screen>
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r
</screen>

    <para>In this first example, the user <literal>harry</literal> has
      full read and write access on the
      <filename>/branches/calc/bug-142</filename> directory in the
      <literal>calc</literal> repository, but the user
      <literal>sally</literal> has read-only access.  Any other users
      are blocked from accessing this directory.</para>

    <para>Of course, permissions are inherited from parent to child
      directory.  That means we can specify a subdirectory with a
      different access policy for Sally:</para>

    <screen>
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

# give sally write access only to the 'testing' subdir
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/testing]
sally = rw
</screen>

    <para>Now Sally can write to the <filename>testing</filename>
      subdirectory of the branch, but can still only read other parts.
      Harry, meanwhile, continues to have complete read/write access
      to the whole branch.</para>

    <para>It's also possible to explicitly deny permission to someone
      via inheritance rules, by setting the username variable to
      nothing:</para>

    <screen>
[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142]
harry = rw
sally = r

[calc:/branches/calc/bug-142/secret]
harry =
</screen>

    <para>In this example, Harry has read/write access to the
      entire <filename>bug-142</filename> tree, but has absolutely no
      access at all to the <filename>secret</filename> subdirectory
      within it.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>The thing to remember is that the most specific path
        always matches first.  The server tries to match the path
        itself, and then the parent of the path, then the parent of
        that, and so on.  The net effect is that mentioning a specific
        path in the access file will always override any permissions
        inherited from parent directories.</para>
    </tip>

    <para>By default, nobody has any access to the repository at all.
      That means that if you're starting with an empty file, you'll
      probably want to give at least read permission to all users at
      the root of the repository.  You can do this by using the
      asterisk variable (<literal>*</literal>), which means <quote>all
      users</quote>:</para>

    <screen>
[/]
* = r
</screen>

    <para>This is a common setup; notice that no repository
      name is mentioned in the section name.  This makes all repositories
      world-readable to all users. Once all users have read access to
      the repositories, you can give explicit
      <literal>rw</literal> permission to certain users on specific
      subdirectories within specific repositories.</para>

    <para>The asterisk variable (<literal>*</literal>) is also worth
      special mention because it's the
      <emphasis>only</emphasis> pattern that matches an anonymous
      user.  If you've configured your server block to allow a mixture
      of anonymous and authenticated access, all users start out
      accessing anonymously.  The server looks for a
      <literal>*</literal> value defined for the path being accessed;
      if it can't find one, it demands real authentication from
      the client.</para>

    <para>The access file also allows you to define whole groups of
      users, much like the Unix <filename>/etc/group</filename>
      file:</para>

    <screen>
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = harry, sally, joe, frank, sally, jane
</screen>

    <para>Groups can be granted access control just like users.
      Distinguish them with an <quote>at</quote>
      (<literal>@</literal>) prefix:</para>

    <screen>
[calc:/projects/calc]
@calc-developers = rw

[paint:/projects/paint]
jane = r
@paint-developers = rw
</screen>

    <para>Another important fact is that
    the <emphasis>first</emphasis> matching rule is the one which gets
    applied to a user.  In the prior example, even though Jane is a
    member of the <literal>paint-developers</literal> group (which has
    read/write access), the <literal>jane = r</literal> rule will be
    discovered and matched before the group rule, thus denying Jane
    write access.</para>

    <para>Groups can also be defined to contain other groups:</para>

    <screen>
[groups]
calc-developers = harry, sally, joe
paint-developers = frank, sally, jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</screen>

    <para>Subversion 1.5 brings another useful feature to the access
      file syntax:  username aliases.  Some authentication systems
      expect and carry relatively short usernames of the sorts we've
      been describing here&#x2014;<literal>harry</literal>,
      <literal>sally</literal>, <literal>joe</literal>, and so on.  But
      other authentication systems&#x2014;such as those which use LDAP
      stores or SSL client certificates&#x2014;may carry much more
      complex usernames.  For example, Harry's username in an
      LDAP-protected system might be <literal>CN=Harold
      Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com</literal>.  With
      usernames like that, the access file can become quite bloated
      with long or obscure usernames that are easy to mistype.
      Fortunately, username aliases allow you to have to type the
      correct complex username only once, in a statement which assigns to
      it a more easily digestable alias.</para>

    <screen>
[aliases]
harry = CN=Harold Hacker,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
sally = CN=Sally Swatterbug,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
joe = CN=Gerald I. Joseph,OU=Engineers,DC=red-bean,DC=com
&#x2026;
</screen>

    <para>Once you've defined a set of aliases, you can refer to the
      users elsewhere in the access file via their aliases in all the
      same places you could have instead used their actual usernames.
      Simply prepend an ampersand to the alias to distinguish it from
      a regular username:</para>

    <screen>
[groups]
calc-developers = &amp;harry, &amp;sally, &amp;joe
paint-developers = &amp;frank, &amp;sally, &amp;jane
everyone = @calc-developers, @paint-developers
</screen>

    <para>You might also choose to use aliases if your users'
      usernames change frequently.  Doing so allows you to need to
      update only the aliases table when these username changes occur,
      instead of doing global-search-and-replace operations on the
      whole access file.</para>

    <title>Partial Readability and Checkouts</title>

    <para>If you're using Apache as your Subversion server and have
      made certain subdirectories of your repository unreadable to
      certain users, you need to be aware of a possible
      nonoptimal behavior with <command>svn checkout</command>.</para>

    <para>When the client requests a checkout or update over HTTP, it
      makes a single server request and receives a single (often
      large) server response.  When the server receives the request,
      that is the <emphasis>only</emphasis> opportunity Apache has to
      demand user authentication.  This has some odd side effects.
      For example, if a certain subdirectory of the repository is
      readable only by user Sally, and user Harry checks out a parent
      directory, his client will respond to the initial authentication
      challenge as Harry.  As the server generates the large response,
      there's no way it can resend an authentication challenge when
      it reaches the special subdirectory; thus the subdirectory is
      skipped altogether, rather than asking the user to
      reauthenticate as Sally at the right moment.  In a similar way,
      if the root of the repository is anonymously world-readable,
      the entire checkout will be done without
      authentication&#x2014;again, skipping the unreadable directory,
      rather than asking for authentication partway through.</para>

    <title>Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods</title>

    <para>You've seen how a repository can be accessed in many
      different ways.  But is it possible&#x2014;or safe&#x2014;for your
      repository to be accessed by multiple methods simultaneously?
      The answer is yes, provided you use a bit of foresight.</para>

    <para>At any given time, these processes may require read and
      write access to your repository:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Regular system users using a Subversion client (as
          themselves) to access the repository directly via
          <literal>file://</literal> URLs</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Regular system users connecting to SSH-spawned private
          <command>svnserve</command> processes (running as
          themselves), which access the repository</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>An <command>svnserve</command> process&#x2014;either a
          daemon or one launched by
          <command>inetd</command>&#x2014;running as a particular fixed
          user</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>An Apache <command>httpd</command> process, running as a
          particular fixed user</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The most common problem administrators run into is
      repository ownership and permissions.  Does every process (or
      user) in the preceding list have the rights to read and write the
      repository's underlying data files?  Assuming you have a
      Unix-like operating system, a straightforward approach might be
      to place every potential repository user into a
      new <literal>svn</literal> group, and make the repository wholly
      owned by that group.  But even that's not enough, because a
      process may write to the database files using an unfriendly
      umask&#x2014;one that prevents access by other users.</para>

    <para>So the next step beyond setting up a common group for
      repository users is to force every repository-accessing process
      to use a sane umask.  For users accessing the repository
      directly, you can make the <command>svn</command> program into a
      wrapper script that first runs <userinput>umask 002</userinput> and
      then runs the real <command>svn</command> client program.  You
      can write a similar wrapper script for the
      <command>svnserve</command> program, and add a <userinput>umask
      002</userinput> command to Apache's own startup script,
      <filename>apachectl</filename>.  For example:</para>

    <screen>
$ cat /usr/bin/svn

#!/bin/sh

umask 002
/usr/bin/svn-real "$@"

</screen>

    <para>Another common problem is often encountered on Unix-like
      systems.  If your repository is backed by Berkeley DB, for
      example, it occasionally creates new log files to journal its
      actions.  Even if the Berkeley DB repository is wholly owned by
      the <command>svn</command> group, these newly created log files
      won't necessarily be owned by that same group, which then
      creates more permissions problems for your users.  A good
      workaround is to set the group SUID bit on the
      repository's <filename>db</filename> directory. This causes all
      newly created log files to have the same group owner as the
      parent directory.</para>

    <para>Once you've jumped through these hoops, your repository
      should be accessible by all the necessary processes.  It may
      seem a bit messy and complicated, but the problems of having
      multiple users sharing write access to common files are classic
      ones that are not often elegantly solved.</para>

    <para>Fortunately, most repository administrators will never
      <emphasis>need</emphasis> to have such a complex configuration.
      Users who wish to access repositories that live on the same
      machine are not limited to using <literal>file://</literal>
      access URLs&#x2014;they can typically contact the Apache HTTP
      server or <command>svnserve</command> using
      <literal>localhost</literal> for the server name in their
      <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>svn://</literal> URL.
      And maintaining multiple server processes for your Subversion
      repositories is likely to be more of a headache than necessary.
      We recommend that you choose a single server that best meets your
      needs and stick with it!</para>

      <title>The svn+ssh:// Server Checklist</title>

      <para>It can be quite tricky to get a bunch of users with
        existing SSH accounts to share a repository without
        permissions problems.  If you're confused about all the things
        that you (as an administrator) need to do on a Unix-like
        system, here's a quick checklist that resummarizes some of the
        topics discussed in this section:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All of your SSH users need to be able to read and
            write to the repository, so put all the SSH users into a
            single group.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Make the repository wholly owned by that group.
            </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Set the group permissions to
            read/write.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Your users need to use a sane umask when accessing the
            repository, so make sure <command>svnserve</command>
            (<filename>/usr/bin/svnserve</filename>, or wherever it
            lives in <literal>$PATH</literal>) is actually a wrapper
            script that runs <userinput>umask 002</userinput> and
            executes the real <command>svnserve</command>
            binary.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Take similar measures when using
            <command>svnlook</command> and
            <command>svnadmin</command>.  Either run them with a sane
            umask or wrap them as just described.</para>

  <title>Customizing Your Subversion Experience</title>

  <para>Version control can be a complex subject, as much art as
    science, that offers myriad ways of getting stuff done.
    Throughout this book, you've read of the various Subversion
    command-line client subcommands and the options that modify their
    behavior.  In this chapter, we'll look into still more ways to
    customize the way Subversion works for you&#x2014;setting up the
    Subversion runtime configuration, using external helper
    applications, Subversion's interaction with the operating system's
    configured locale, and so on.</para>

  <!-- TODO(cmpilato): Gut the runtime config stuff like I did the
       property stuff, making larger topical sections to which the
       runtime config stuff generally refers.  Like already exists for
       external diff/diff3, add, for example, a section on external
       editors. -->

  <sect1 id="svn.advanced.confarea">
    <title>Runtime Configuration Area</title>
    
    <para>Subversion provides many optional behaviors that the user can
      control.  Many of these options are of the kind
      that a user would wish to apply to all Subversion operations.
      So, rather than forcing users to remember command-line arguments
      for specifying these options and to use them for every
      operation they perform, Subversion uses configuration files,
      segregated into a Subversion configuration area.</para>

    <para>The Subversion <firstterm>configuration area</firstterm> is
      a two-tiered hierarchy of option names and their values.
      Usually, this boils down to a special directory that contains
      <firstterm>configuration files</firstterm> (the first tier),
      which are just text files in standard INI format (with
      <quote>sections</quote> providing the second tier).  You can
      easily edit these files using your favorite text editor (such as
      Emacs or vi), and they contain directives read by the client to
      determine which of several optional behaviors the user
      prefers.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.confarea.layout">
      <title>Configuration Area Layout</title>

      <para>The first time the <command>svn</command>
        command-line client is executed, it creates a per-user
        configuration area.  On Unix-like systems, this area appears
        as a directory named <filename>.subversion</filename> in the
        user's home directory.  On Win32 systems, Subversion creates a
        folder named <filename>Subversion</filename>, typically inside
        the <filename>Application Data</filename> area of the user's
        profile directory (which, by the way, is usually a hidden
        directory).  However, on this platform, the exact location
        differs from system to system and is dictated by the Windows
        Registry.
        <footnote>
          <para>The <literal>APPDATA</literal> environment variable
            points to the <filename>Application Data</filename> area,
            so you can always refer to this folder as
            <filename>%APPDATA%\Subversion</filename>.</para>
        </footnote>
        We will refer to the per-user configuration area using its Unix
        name, <filename>.subversion</filename>.</para>

      <para>In addition to the per-user configuration area, Subversion
        also recognizes the existence of a system-wide configuration
        area.  This gives system administrators the ability to
        establish defaults for all users on a given machine.  Note
        that the system-wide configuration area alone does not dictate
        mandatory policy&#x2014;the settings in the per-user
        configuration area override those in the system-wide one, and
        command-line arguments supplied to the <command>svn</command>
        program have the final word on behavior.  On Unix-like
        platforms, the system-wide configuration area is
        expected to be the <filename>/etc/subversion</filename>
        directory; on Windows machines, it looks for a
        <filename>Subversion</filename> directory inside the common
        <filename>Application Data</filename> location (again, as
        specified by the Windows Registry).  Unlike the per-user
        case, the <command>svn</command> program does not attempt
        to create the system-wide configuration area.</para>

      <para>The per-user configuration area currently contains three
        files&#x2014;two configuration files (<filename>config</filename> and
        <filename>servers</filename>), and a <filename>README.txt</filename> 
        file, which describes the INI format.  At the time of their
        creation, the files contain default values for each of the
        supported Subversion options, mostly commented out and grouped
        with textual descriptions about how the values for the key
        affect Subversion's behavior.  To change a certain behavior,
        you need only to load the appropriate configuration file into
        a text editor, and to modify the desired option's value.  If at
        any time you wish to have the default configuration settings
        restored, you can simply remove (or rename) your configuration
        directory and then run some innocuous <command>svn</command>
        command, such as <userinput>svn --version</userinput>.  A new
        configuration directory with the default contents will be
        created.</para>

      <para>The per-user configuration area also contains a cache of
        authentication data.  The <filename>auth</filename> directory
        holds a set of subdirectories that contain pieces of cached
        information used by Subversion's various supported
        authentication methods.  This directory is created in such a
        way that only the user herself has permission to read its
        contents.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry">
      <title>Configuration and the Windows Registry</title>

      <para>In addition to the usual INI-based configuration area,
        Subversion clients running on Windows platforms may also use
        the Windows Registry to hold the configuration data.  The
        option names and their values are the same as in the INI
        files.  The <quote>file/section</quote> hierarchy is
        preserved as well, though addressed in a slightly different
        fashion&#x2014;in this schema, files and sections are just
        levels in the Registry key tree.</para>

      <para>Subversion looks for system-wide configuration values
        under the
        <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</literal>
        key.  For example, the <literal>global-ignores</literal> option,
        which is in the <literal>miscellany</literal> section of the
        <filename>config</filename> file, would be found at
        <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</literal>.
        Per-user configuration values should be stored under
        <literal>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Tigris.org\Subversion</literal>.
      </para>

      <para>Registry-based configuration options are parsed
        <emphasis>before</emphasis> their file-based counterparts, so
        they are overridden by values found in the configuration files.  In
        other words, Subversion looks for configuration information in
        the following locations on a Windows system; lower-numbered
        locations take precedence over higher-numbered locations:</para>
      
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Command-line options</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The per-user INI files</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The system-wide Registry values</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Also, the Windows Registry doesn't really support the
        notion of something being <quote>commented out.</quote>
        However, Subversion will ignore any option key whose name
        begins with a hash (<literal>#</literal>) character.  This
        allows you to effectively comment out a Subversion option
        without deleting the entire key from the Registry, obviously
        simplifying the process of restoring that option.</para>

      <para>The <command>svn</command> command-line client never
        attempts to write to the Windows Registry and will not attempt
        to create a default configuration area there.  You can create
        the keys you need using the <command>REGEDIT</command>
        program.  Alternatively, you can create a
        <filename>.reg</filename> file (such as the one in <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.windows-registry.ex-1"/>), and
        then double-click on that file's icon in the Explorer shell,
        which will cause the data to be merged into your
        Registry.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>The value of this option is a space-delimited list
                of file extensions that Subversion should preserve
                when generating conflict filenames.  By default, the
                list is empty.  This option is new to Subversion
                1.5.</para>

              <para>When Subversion detects conflicting file content
                changes, it defers resolution of those conflicts to the
                user.  To assist in the resolution, Subversion keeps
                pristine copies of the various competing versions of
                the file in the working copy.  By default, those
                conflict files have names constructed by appending to
                the original filename a custom extension such as
                <filename>.mine</filename> or
                <filename>.<replaceable>REV</replaceable></filename>
                (where <replaceable>REV</replaceable> is a revision
                number).  A mild annoyance with this naming scheme is
                that on operating systems where a file's extension
                determines the default application used to open and
                edit that file, appending a custom extension prevents
                the file from being easily opened by its native
                application.  For example, if the file
                <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf</filename> was conflicted,
                the conflict files might be named
                <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine</filename> or
                <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231</filename>.  While
                your system might be configured to use Adobe's Acrobat
                Reader to open files whose extensions are
                <filename>.pdf</filename>, there probably isn't an
                application configured on your system to open all
                files whose extensions are
                <filename>.r4231</filename>.</para>

              <para>You can fix this annoyance by using this
                configuration option, though.  For files with one of
                the specified extensions, Subversion will append to
                the conflict file names the custom extension just as
                before, but then also reappend the file's original
                extension.  Using the previous example, and assuming
                that <literal>pdf</literal> is one of the extensions
                configured in this list thereof, the conflict files
                generated for <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf</filename>
                would instead be named
                <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine.pdf</filename> and
                <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231.pdf</filename>.
                Because each file ends in
                <filename>.pdf</filename>, the correct default
                application will be used to view them.</para>

    <title>Localization</title>

    <para><firstterm>Localization</firstterm> is the act of making
      programs behave in a region-specific way.  When a program
      formats numbers or dates in a way specific to your part of the
      world or prints messages (or accepts input) in your native
      language, the program is said to
      be <firstterm>localized</firstterm>.  This section describes
      steps Subversion has made toward localization.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.l10n.understanding">
      <title>Understanding Locales</title>
      
      <para>Most modern operating systems have a notion of the
        <quote>current locale</quote>&#x2014;that is, the region or
        country whose localization conventions are honored.  These
        conventions&#x2014;typically chosen by some runtime
        configuration mechanism on the computer&#x2014;affect the way
        in which programs present data to the user, as well as the way
        in which they accept user input.</para>

      <para>On most Unix-like systems, you can check the values of the
        locale-related runtime configuration options by running the
        <command>locale</command> command:</para>

      <screen>
$ locale
LANG=
LC_COLLATE="C"
LC_CTYPE="C"
LC_MESSAGES="C"
LC_MONETARY="C"
LC_NUMERIC="C"
LC_TIME="C"
LC_ALL="C"
$
</screen>

      <para>The output is a list of locale-related environment
        variables and their current values.  In this example, the
        variables are all set to the default <literal>C</literal>
        locale, but users can set these variables to specific
        country/language code combinations.  For example, if one were
        to set the <literal>LC_TIME</literal> variable to
        <literal>fr_CA</literal>, programs would know to present
        time and date information formatted according to a
        French-speaking Canadian's expectations.  And if one were to
        set the <literal>LC_MESSAGES</literal> variable to
        <literal>zh_TW</literal>, programs would know to present
        human-readable messages in Traditional Chinese.  Setting the
        <literal>LC_ALL</literal> variable has the effect of changing
        every locale variable to the same value.  The value of
        <literal>LANG</literal> is used as a default value for any
        locale variable that is unset.  To see the list of available
        locales on a Unix system, run the command <userinput>locale
        -a</userinput>.</para>

      <para>On Windows, locale configuration is done via the
        <quote>Regional and Language Options</quote> control panel
        item.  There you can view and select the values of individual
        settings from the available locales, and even customize (at a
        sickening level of detail) several of the display formatting
        conventions.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.advanced.l10n.svnuse">
      <title>Subversion's Use of Locales</title>

      <para>The Subversion client, <command>svn</command>, honors the
        current locale configuration in two ways.  First, it notices
        the value of the <literal>LC_MESSAGES</literal> variable and
        attempts to print all messages in the specified language.  For
        example:</para>

      <screen>
$ export LC_MESSAGES=de_DE
$ svn help cat
cat: Gibt den Inhalt der angegebenen Dateien oder URLs aus.
Aufruf: cat ZIEL[@REV]...
&#x2026;
</screen>

      <para>This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows
        systems.  Note, though, that while your operating system might
        have support for a certain locale, the Subversion client still
        may not be able to speak the particular language.  In order to
        produce localized messages, human volunteers must provide
        translations for each language.  The translations are written
        using the GNU gettext package, which results in translation
        modules that end with the <filename>.mo</filename> filename
        extension.  For example, the German translation file is named
        <filename>de.mo</filename>.  These translation files are
        installed somewhere on your system.  On Unix, they typically
        live in <filename>/usr/share/locale/</filename>, while
        on Windows they're often found in the
        <filename>share\locale\</filename> folder in Subversion's
        installation area.  Once installed, a module is named after
        the program for which it provides translations.  For example, the
        <filename>de.mo</filename> file may ultimately end up
        installed as
        <filename>/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</filename>.
        By browsing the installed <filename>.mo</filename> files, you
        can see which languages the Subversion client is able to
        speak.</para>

      <para>The second way in which the locale is honored involves how
        <command>svn</command> interprets your input.  The repository
        stores all paths, filenames, and log messages in Unicode,
        encoded as UTF-8.  In that sense, the repository is
        <firstterm>internationalized</firstterm>&#x2014;that is, the
        repository is ready to accept input in any human language.
        This means, however, that the Subversion client is responsible
        for sending only UTF-8 filenames and log messages into the
        repository.  To do this, it must convert the data
        from the native locale into UTF-8.</para>

      <para>For example, suppose you create a file named
        <filename>caff&#xE8;.txt</filename>, and then when committing the
        file, you write the log message as <quote>Adesso il caff&#xE8; &#xE8;
        pi&#xF9; forte.</quote>  Both the filename and the log message contain
        non-ASCII characters, but because your locale is set to
        <literal>it_IT</literal>, the Subversion client knows to
        interpret them as Italian.  It uses an Italian character set
        to convert the data to UTF-8 before sending it off to the
        repository.</para>

      <para>Note that while the repository demands UTF-8 filenames and
        log messages, it <emphasis>does not</emphasis> pay attention
        to file contents.  Subversion treats file contents as opaque
        strings of bytes, and neither client nor server makes an
        attempt to understand the character set or encoding of the
        contents.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Character Set Conversion Errors</title>

        <para>While using Subversion, you might get hit with an error
          related to character set conversions:</para>

        <screen>
svn: Can't convert string from native encoding to 'UTF-8':
&#x2026;
svn: Can't convert string from 'UTF-8' to native encoding:
&#x2026;
</screen>
    
        <para>Errors such as this typically occur when the Subversion
          client has received a UTF-8 string from the repository, but
          not all of the characters in that string can be represented
          using the encoding of the current locale.  For example, if
          your locale is <literal>en_US</literal> but a collaborator
          has committed a Japanese filename, you're likely to see this
          error when you receive the file during an <command>svn
          update</command>.</para>

        <para>The solution is either to set your locale to something
          that <emphasis>can</emphasis> represent the incoming UTF-8
          data, or to change the filename or log message in the
          repository.  (And don't forget to slap your collaborator's
          hand&#x2014;projects should decide on common languages ahead of
          time so that all participants are using the same
          locale.)</para>

    <title>Using External Editors</title>

    <para>The most obvious way to get data into Subversion is through
      the addition of files to version control, committing changes to
      those files, and so on.  But other pieces of
      information besides merely versioned file data live in your
      Subversion repository.  Some of these bits of
      information&#x2014;commit log messages, lock comments, and some
      property values&#x2014;tend to be textual in nature and are
      provided explicitly by users.  Most of this information can be
      provided to the Subversion command-line client using the
      <option>--message</option> (<option>-m</option>) and
      <option>--file</option> (<option>-F</option>) options with the
      appropriate subcommands.</para>

    <para>Each of these options has its pros and cons.  For example,
      when performing a commit, <option>--file</option>
      (<option>-F</option>) works well if you've already prepared a
      text file that holds your commit log message.  If you didn't,
      though, you can use <option>--message</option>
      (<option>-m</option>) to provide a log message on the command
      line.  Unfortunately, it can be tricky to compose anything more
      than a simple one-line message on the command line.  Users want
      more flexibility&#x2014;multiline, free-form log message editing
      on demand.</para>
      
    <para>Subversion supports this by allowing you to specify an
      external text editor that it will launch as necessary
      to give you a more powerful input mechanism for this textual
      metadata.  There are several ways to tell Subversion which
      editor you'd like use.  Subversion checks the following things,
      in the order specified, when it wants to launch such an
      editor:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><literal>--editor-cmd</literal> command-line option</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><literal>SVN_EDITOR</literal> environment variable</para>

        <para>Possibly, a fallback value built into the Subversion
          libraries (not present in the official builds)</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>The value of any of these options or variables is the
      beginning of a command line to be executed by the shell.
      Subversion appends to that command line a space and the pathname
      of a temporary file to be edited.  So, to be used with
      Subversion, the configured or specified editor needs to support
      an invocation in which its last command-line parameter is a file
      to be edited, and it should be able to save the file in place
      and return a zero exit code to indicate success.</para>

    <para>As noted, external editors can be used to provide commit log
      messages to any of the committing subcommands (such as
      <command>svn commit</command> or <command>import</command>,
      <command>svn mkdir</command> or <command>delete</command> when
      provided a URL target, etc.), and Subversion will try to
      launch the editor automatically if you don't specify either of
      the <option>--message</option> (<option>-m</option>) or
      <option>--file</option> (<option>-F</option>) options.  The
      <command>svn propedit</command> command is built almost entirely
      around the use of an external editor.  And beginning in version
      1.5, Subversion will also use the configured external text
      editor when the user asks it to launch an editor during
      interactive conflict resolution.  Oddly, there doesn't appear to
      be a way to use external editors to interactively provide lock
      comments.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.advanced.externaldifftools">
    <title>Using External Differencing and Merge Tools</title>

    <para>The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
      differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only
      contextual differencing capabilities were built around
      invocations of the GNU diffutils toolchain, specifically the
      <command>diff</command> and <command>diff3</command> utilities.
      To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these
      utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters,
      most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time
      later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library,
      and as a failover mechanism, the <option>--diff-cmd</option> and
      <option>--diff3-cmd</option> options were added to the
      Subversion command-line client so that users could more easily
      indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3
      utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.  If
      those options were used, Subversion would simply ignore the
      internal diff library, and fall back to running those external
      programs, lengthy argument lists and all.  And that's where
      things remain today.</para>

    <para>It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such
      easy configuration mechanisms for specifying that Subversion
      should use the external GNU diff and diff3 utilities located at
      a particular place on the system could be applied toward the use
      of other differencing tools, too.  After all, Subversion didn't
      actually verify that the things it was being told to run were
      members of the GNU diffutils toolchain.  But the only
      configurable aspect of using those external tools is their
      location on the system&#x2014;not the option set, parameter
      order, and so on.  Subversion continues to throw all those GNU utility
      options at your external diff tool regardless of whether
      that program can understand those options.  And that's where
      things get unintuitive for most users.</para>

    <para>The key to using external two- and three-way differencing tools
      (other than GNU diff and diff3, of course) with Subversion is to
      use wrapper scripts, which convert the input from Subversion into
      something that your differencing tool can understand, and then
      to convert the output of your tool back into a format that
      Subversion expects&#x2014;the format that the GNU tools would
      have used.  The following sections cover the specifics of those
      expectations.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way
        diff as part of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely
        by Subversion and is affected by, among other things, whether
        the files being operated on are human-readable as
        determined by their <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property.
        This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
        Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the
        universe, it would never be invoked by Subversion as long as
        your versioned Word documents had a configured MIME type that

    <para>Subversion 1.5 introduces interactive resolution of
      conflicts (described in <xref linkend="svn.tour.cycle.resolve"/>), and one of the options provided to users is the ability to
      launch a third-party merge tool.  If this action is taken,
      Subversion will consult the <literal>merge-tool-cmd</literal>
      runtime configuration option to find the name of an external
      merge tool and, upon finding one, will launch that tool with the
      appropriate input files.  This differs from the configurable
      three-way differencing tool in a couple of ways.  First, the
      differencing tool is always used to handle three-way
      differences, whereas the merge tool is employed only when
      three-way difference application has detected a conflict.
      Second, the interface is much cleaner&#x2014;your configured
      merge tool need only accept as command-line parameters four path
      specifications:  the base file, the <quote>theirs</quote> file
      (which contains upstream changes), the <quote>mine</quote> file
      (which contains local modifications), and the path of the file
      where the final resolved contents should be stored.</para>

        that Subversion runs the diff program once per modified file
        covered by the Subversion operation, so if your program runs
        in an asynchronous fashion (or is <quote>backgrounded</quote>),
        you might have several instances of it all running

    <para>Sometimes there's a single right way to do things; sometimes
      there are many.  Subversion's developers understand that while
      the majority of its exact behaviors are acceptable to most of
      its users, there are some corners of its functionality where
      such a universally pleasing approach doesn't exist.  In those

  <title>Embedding Subversion</title>
  
  <para>Subversion has a modular design: it's implemented as a
    collection of libraries written in C.  Each library has a
    well-defined purpose and application programming interface (API),
    and that interface is available not only for Subversion itself to
    use, but for any software that wishes to embed or otherwise
    programmatically control Subversion.  Additionally, Subversion's
    API is available not only to other C programs, but also to
    programs written in higher-level languages such as Python, Perl,
    Java, and Ruby.</para>

  <para>This chapter is for those who wish to interact with Subversion
    through its public API or its various language bindings.  If you
    wish to write robust wrapper scripts around Subversion
    functionality to simplify your own life, are trying to develop
    more complex integrations between Subversion and other pieces of
    software, or just have an interest in Subversion's various library
    modules and what they offer, this chapter is for you.  If,
    however, you don't foresee yourself participating with Subversion
    at such a level, feel free to skip this chapter with the

    <para>The fact that the word <quote>miscellaneous</quote>
      appears only once in the previous list is a good sign.  The
      Subversion development team is serious about making sure that
      functionality lives in the right layer and libraries.  Perhaps
      the greatest advantage of the modular design is its lack of
      complexity from a developer's point of view.  As a developer,
      you can quickly formulate that kind of <quote>big
      picture</quote> that allows you to pinpoint the location of
      certain pieces of functionality with relative ease.</para>

    <para>Another benefit of modularity is the ability to replace a
      given module with a whole new library that implements the same
      API without affecting the rest of the code base.  In some sense,
      this happens within Subversion already.  The
      <filename>libsvn_ra_local</filename>,
      <filename>libsvn_ra_neon</filename>,
      <filename>libsvn_ra_serf</filename>, and
      <filename>libsvn_ra_svn</filename> libraries each implement the
      same interface, all working as plug-ins to
      <filename>libsvn_ra</filename>.  And all four communicate with
      the Repository layer&#x2014;<filename>libsvn_ra_local</filename> connects to the
      repository directly; the other three do so over a network.  The
      <filename>libsvn_fs_base</filename> and
      <filename>libsvn_fs_fs</filename> libraries are another pair of
      libraries that implement the same functionality in different
      ways&#x2014;both are plug-ins to the common
      <filename>libsvn_fs</filename> library.</para>

    <para>The client itself also highlights the benefits of modularity
      in the Subversion design.  Subversion's
      <filename>libsvn_client</filename> library is a one-stop shop
      for most of the functionality necessary for designing a working
      Subversion client (see <xref linkend="svn.developer.layerlib.client"/>).  So while the
      Subversion distribution provides only the <command>svn</command>
      command-line client program, several third-party
      programs provide various forms of graphical client UIs.
      These GUIs use the same APIs that the stock command-line client
      does.  This type of modularity has played a large role in the
      proliferation of available Subversion clients and IDE
      integrations and, by extension, to the tremendous adoption rate
      of Subversion itself.</para>

    <!-- =============================================================== -->
    <sect2 id="svn.developer.layerlib.repos">
      <title>Repository Layer</title>

      <para>When referring to Subversion's Repository layer, we're
        generally talking about two basic concepts&#x2014;the versioned
        filesystem implementation (accessed via
        <filename>libsvn_fs</filename>, and supported by its
        <filename>libsvn_fs_base</filename> and
        <filename>libsvn_fs_fs</filename> plug-ins), and the repository
        logic that wraps it (as implemented in
        <filename>libsvn_repos</filename>).  These libraries provide
        the storage and reporting mechanisms for the various revisions
        of your version-controlled data.  This layer is connected to
        the Client layer via the Repository Access layer, and is, from
        the perspective of the Subversion user, the stuff at the
        <quote>other end of the line.</quote></para>

      <para>The Subversion filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem
        that one would install in an operating system (such as the
        Linux ext2 or NTFS), but instead is a virtual filesystem.
        Rather than storing <quote>files</quote> and
        <quote>directories</quote> as real files and directories (the
        kind you can navigate through using your favorite shell
        program), it uses one of two available abstract storage
        backends&#x2014;either a Berkeley DB database environment or a
        flat-file representation.  (To learn more about the two
        repository backends, see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends"/>.)  There has even
        been considerable interest by the development community in
        giving future releases of Subversion the ability to use other
        backend database systems, perhaps through a mechanism such as
        Open Database Connectivity (ODBC).  In fact, Google did
        something similar to this before launching the Google Code
        Project Hosting service:  they announced in mid-2006 that
        members of its open source team had written a new proprietary
        Subversion filesystem plug-in that used Google's ultra-scalable
        Bigtable database for its storage.</para>

      <para>The filesystem API exported by
        <filename>libsvn_fs</filename> contains the kinds of
        functionality you would expect from any other filesystem
        API&#x2014;you can create and remove files and directories,
        copy and move them around, modify file contents, and so on.
        It also has features that are not quite as common, such as the
        ability to add, modify, and remove metadata
        (<quote>properties</quote>) on each file or directory.
        Furthermore, the Subversion filesystem is a versioning
        filesystem, which means that as you make changes to your
        directory tree, Subversion remembers what your tree looked
        like before those changes.  And before the previous changes.
        And the previous ones.  And so on, all the way back through
        versioning time to (and just beyond) the moment you first
        started adding things to the filesystem.</para>

      <para>All the modifications you make to your tree are done
        within the context of a Subversion commit transaction.  The
        following is a simplified general routine for modifying your
        filesystem:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Begin a Subversion commit transaction.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Make your changes (adds, deletes, property
            modifications, etc.).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Commit your transaction.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Once you have committed your transaction, your filesystem
        modifications are permanently stored as historical artifacts.
        Each of these cycles generates a single new revision of your
        tree, and each revision is forever accessible as an immutable
        snapshot of <quote>the way things were.</quote></para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>The Transaction Distraction</title>

        <para>The notion of a Subversion transaction can become easily
          confused with the transaction support provided by the
          underlying database itself, especially given the former's
          close proximity to the Berkeley DB database code in
          <filename>libsvn_fs_base</filename>.  Both types of
          transaction exist to provide atomicity and isolation.  In
          other words, transactions give you the ability to perform a
          set of actions in an all-or-nothing fashion&#x2014;either all
          the actions in the set complete with success, or they all
          get treated as though <emphasis>none</emphasis> of them ever
          happened&#x2014;and in a way that does not interfere with
          other processes acting on the data.</para>

        <para>Database transactions generally encompass small
          operations related specifically to the modification of data
          in the database itself (such as changing the contents of a
          table row).  Subversion transactions are larger in scope,
          encompassing higher-level operations such as making
          modifications to a set of files and directories that are
          intended to be stored as the next revision of the filesystem
          tree.  If that isn't confusing enough, consider the fact
          that Subversion uses a database transaction during the
          creation of a Subversion transaction (so that if the
          creation of a Subversion transaction fails, the database will
          look as though we had never attempted that creation in the first
          place)!</para>

        <para>Fortunately for users of the filesystem API, the
          transaction support provided by the database system itself
          is hidden almost entirely from view (as should be expected
          from a properly modularized library scheme).  It is only
          when you start digging into the implementation of the
          filesystem itself that such things become visible (or
          interesting).</para>

      </sidebar>

      <para>Most of the functionality the filesystem
        interface provides deals with actions that occur on individual
        filesystem paths.  That is, from outside the filesystem, the
        primary mechanism for describing and accessing the individual
        revisions of files and directories comes through the use of
        path strings such as <filename>/foo/bar</filename>, just as though
        you were addressing files and directories through your
        favorite shell program.  You add new files and directories by
        passing their paths-to-be to the right API functions.  You
        query for information about them by the same mechanism.</para>

      <para>Unlike most filesystems, though, a path alone is not
        enough information to identify a file or directory in
        Subversion.  Think of a directory tree as a two-dimensional

      <para>As we mentioned earlier, the
        <filename>libsvn_fs</filename> API looks and feels like any
        other filesystem, except that it has this wonderful versioning
        capability.  It was designed to be usable by any program
        interested in a versioning filesystem.  Not coincidentally,
        Subversion itself is interested in that functionality.  But
        while the filesystem API should be sufficient for basic file
        and directory versioning support, Subversion wants
        more&#x2014;and that is where <filename>libsvn_repos</filename>
        comes in.</para>

      <para>The Subversion repository library
        (<filename>libsvn_repos</filename>) sits (logically speaking)
        atop the <filename>libsvn_fs</filename> API, providing
        additional functionality beyond that of the underlying
        versioned filesystem logic.  It does not completely wrap each
        and every filesystem function&#x2014;only certain major steps
        in the general cycle of filesystem activity are wrapped by the
        repository interface.  Some of these include the creation and
        commit of Subversion transactions and the modification of
        revision properties.  These particular events are wrapped by
        the repository layer because they have hooks associated with
        them.  A repository hook system is not strictly related to
        implementing a versioning filesystem, so it lives in the
        repository wrapper library.</para>
      
      <para>The hooks mechanism is but one of the reasons for the
        abstraction of a separate repository library from the rest of
        the filesystem code.  The <filename>libsvn_repos</filename>
        API provides several other important utilities to Subversion.
        These include the abilities to:</para>

      <title>Repository Access Layer</title>

      <para>If the Subversion Repository layer is at <quote>the other
        end of the line,</quote> the Repository Access (RA) layer is
        the line itself.  Charged with marshaling data between the
        client libraries and the repository, this layer includes the
        <filename>libsvn_ra</filename> module loader library, the RA
        modules themselves (which currently includes
        <filename>libsvn_ra_neon</filename>,
        <filename>libsvn_ra_local</filename>,
        <filename>libsvn_ra_serf</filename>, and
        <filename>libsvn_ra_svn</filename>), and any additional
        libraries needed by one or more of those RA modules (such as
        the <filename>mod_dav_svn</filename> Apache module or
        <filename>libsvn_ra_svn</filename>'s server,
        <command>svnserve</command>).</para>

      <para>Since Subversion uses URLs to identify its repository
        resources, the protocol portion of the URL scheme (usually

        <literal>https://</literal>, <literal>svn://</literal>, or
        <literal>svn+ssh://</literal>) is used to determine which RA
        module will handle the communications.  Each module registers
        a list of the protocols it knows how to <quote>speak</quote>
        so that the RA loader can, at runtime, determine which module
        to use for the task at hand.  You can determine which RA
        modules are available to the Subversion command-line client,
        and what protocols they claim to support, by running

Subversion is open source software, see http://subversion.tigris.org/
This product includes software developed by CollabNet (http://www.Collab.Net/).

The following repository access (RA) modules are available:

* ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using Neon.
  - handles 'http' scheme
  - handles 'https' scheme
* ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network protocol.
  - handles 'svn' scheme
* ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.
  - handles 'file' scheme
* ra_serf : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using serf.

      <para>The public API exported by the RA layer contains
        functionality necessary for sending and receiving versioned
        data to and from the repository.  And each of the available RA
        plug-ins is able to perform that task using a specific
        protocol&#x2014;<filename>libsvn_ra_dav</filename> speaks
        HTTP/WebDAV (optionally using SSL encryption) with an Apache
        HTTP Server that is running the
        <filename>mod_dav_svn</filename> Subversion server module;
        <filename>libsvn_ra_svn</filename> speaks a custom network
        protocol with the <command>svnserve</command> program; and so
        on.</para>

      <para>For those who wish to access a Subversion repository
        using still another protocol, that is precisely why the
        Repository Access layer is modularized!  Developers can simply
        write a new library that implements the RA interface on one
        side and communicates with the repository on the other.  Your
        new library can use existing network protocols or you can
        invent your own.  You could use interprocess communication
        (IPC) calls, or&#x2014;let's get crazy, shall we?&#x2014;you
        could even implement an email-based protocol.  Subversion
        supplies the APIs; you supply the creativity.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.developer.layerlib.client">
      <title>Client Layer</title>
      
      <para>On the client side, the Subversion working copy is where
        all the action takes place.  The bulk of functionality
        implemented by the client-side libraries exists for the sole
        purpose of managing working copies&#x2014;directories full of
        files and other subdirectories that serve as a sort of local,
        editable <quote>reflection</quote> of one or more repository
        locations&#x2014;and propagating changes to and from the
        Repository Access layer.</para>

      <para>Subversion's working copy library,
        <filename>libsvn_wc</filename>, is directly responsible for
        managing the data in the working copies.  To accomplish this,
        the library stores administrative information about each
        working copy directory within a special subdirectory.  This
        subdirectory, named <filename>.svn</filename>, is present in
        each working copy directory and contains various other files
        and directories that record state and provide a private
        workspace for administrative action.  For those familiar with
        CVS, this <filename>.svn</filename> subdirectory is similar in
        purpose to the <filename>CVS</filename> administrative
        directories found in CVS working copies.  For more information
        about the <filename>.svn</filename> administrative area, see
        <xref linkend="svn.developer.insidewc"/> later in this
        chapter.</para>

      <para>The Subversion client library,
        <filename>libsvn_client</filename>, has the broadest
        responsibility; its job is to mingle the functionality of the
        working copy library with that of the Repository Access layer,
        and then to provide the highest-level API to any application
        that wishes to perform general revision control actions.  For
        example, the function
        <function>svn_client_checkout()</function> takes a URL as an
        argument.  It passes this URL to the RA layer and opens an
        authenticated session with a particular repository.  It then
        asks the repository for a certain tree, and sends this tree
        into the working copy library, which then writes a full
        working copy to disk (<filename>.svn</filename> directories
        and all).</para>

      <para>The client library is designed to be used by any
        application.  While the Subversion source code includes a
        standard command-line client, it should be very easy to write
        any number of GUI clients on top of the client library.  New
        GUIs (or any new client, really) for Subversion need not be
        clunky wrappers around the included command-line
        client&#x2014;they have full access via the
        <filename>libsvn_client</filename> API to the same functionality,
        data, and callback mechanisms that the command-line client
        uses.  In fact, the Subversion source code tree contains a
        small C program (which you can find at
        <filename>tools/examples/minimal_client.c</filename>) that
        exemplifies how to wield the Subversion API to create a simple
        client program.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>Binding Directly&#x2014;A Word About Correctness</title>

        <para>Why should your GUI program bind directly with a
          <filename>libsvn_client</filename> instead of acting as a
          wrapper around a command-line program?  Besides simply being
          more efficient, it can be more correct as well.  A
          command-line program (such as the one supplied with
          Subversion) that binds to the client library needs to
          effectively translate feedback and requested data bits from
          C types to some form of human-readable output.  This type of
          translation can be lossy.  That is, the program may not
          display all of the information harvested from the API or may
          combine bits of information for compact
          representation.</para>

        <para>If you wrap such a command-line program with yet another
          program, the second program has access only to
          already interpreted (and as we mentioned, likely incomplete)
          information, which it must <emphasis>again</emphasis>
          translate into <emphasis>its</emphasis> representation
          format.  With each layer of wrapping, the integrity of the
          original data is potentially tainted more and more, much
          like the result of making a copy of a copy (of a copy&#x2026;)
          of a favorite audio or video cassette.</para>
 
        <para>But the most compelling argument for binding directly to
          the APIs instead of wrapping other programs is that the
          Subversion project makes compatibility promises regarding
          its APIs.  Across minor versions of those APIs (such as
          between 1.3 and 1.4), no function's prototype will change.
          In other words, you aren't forced to update your program's
          source code simply because you've upgraded to a new version
          of Subversion.  Certain functions might be deprecated, but
          they still work, and this gives you a buffer of time to
          eventually embrace the newer APIs.  These kinds of
          compatibility promises do not exist for Subversion
          command-line program output, which is subject to change from
          release to release.</para>

    <para>As we mentioned earlier, each directory of a Subversion
      working copy contains a special subdirectory called
      <filename>.svn</filename> that houses administrative data about
      that working copy directory.  Subversion uses the information in
      <filename>.svn</filename> to keep track of things such as:</para>

      provides, to access and manipulate the working copy data,
      instead of directly reading or modifying those files.  The file
      formats employed by the working copy library for its
      administrative data do change from time to time&#x2014;a fact
      that the public APIs do a great job of hiding from the average

        contains the bulk of the administrative

        URLs, pristine revision, file checksums, pristine text and

        <filename>CVS/Root</filename>, and

      <para>The format of the <filename>.svn/entries</filename> file

        While XML was a great choice for early developers of
        Subversion who were frequently debugging the file's contents
        (and Subversion's behavior in light of them), the need for
        easy developer debugging has diminished as Subversion has
        matured and has been replaced by the user's need for snappier
        performance.  Be aware that Subversion's working copy library
        automatically upgrades working copies from one format to
        another&#x2014;it reads the old formats and writes the
        new&#x2014;which saves you the hassle of checking out a new
        working copy, but can also complicate situations where
        different versions of Subversion might be trying to use the
        same working copy.</para>

        versions of files.  You can find those in

    <title>Using the APIs</title>

    <para>Developing applications against the Subversion library APIs
      is fairly straightforward.  Subversion is primarily a set of C
      libraries, with header (<filename>.h</filename>) files that live
      in the <filename>subversion/include</filename> directory of the
      source tree.  These headers are copied into your system
      locations (e.g., <filename>/usr/local/include</filename>)
      when you build and install Subversion itself from source.  These
      headers represent the entirety of the functions and types meant
      to be accessible by users of the Subversion libraries.  The
      Subversion developer community is meticulous about ensuring that
      the public API is well documented&#x2014;refer directly to the
      header files for that documentation.</para>

    <para>When examining the public header files, the first thing you
      might notice is that Subversion's datatypes and functions are
      namespace-protected.  That is, every public Subversion symbol
      name begins with <literal>svn_</literal>, followed by a short
      code for the library in which the symbol is defined (such as
      <literal>wc</literal>, <literal>client</literal>,
      <literal>fs</literal>, etc.), followed by a single underscore
      (<literal>_</literal>), and then the rest of the symbol name.
      Semipublic functions (used among source files of a given
      library but not by code outside that library, and found inside
      the library directories themselves) differ from this naming
      scheme in that instead of a single underscore after the library
      code, they use a double underscore
      (<literal>_&#x2009;_</literal>).  Functions that are private to
      a given source file have no special prefixing and are declared
      <literal>static</literal>.  Of course, a compiler isn't
      interested in these naming conventions, but they help to clarify
      the scope of a given function or datatype.</para>

    <para>Another good source of information about programming against
      the Subversion APIs is the project's own hacking guidelines,
      which you can find at <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/hacking.html"/>.  This
      document contains useful information, which, while aimed at

        API for performing operations that differ mildly&#x2014;or
        wildly&#x2014;from OS to OS.  While the Apache HTTP Server was
        obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion
        developers immediately recognized the value of using APR as
        well.  This means that there is practically no OS-specific
        code in Subversion itself.  Also, it means that the Subversion
        client compiles and runs anywhere that the Apache HTTP Server
        does.  Currently, this list includes all flavors of Unix,
        Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X.</para>

      <para>In addition to providing consistent implementations of
        system calls that differ across operating systems,
        <footnote>
          <para>Subversion uses ANSI system calls and datatypes as much
            as possible.</para>
        </footnote>
        APR gives Subversion immediate access to many custom
        datatypes, such as dynamic arrays and hash tables.  Subversion
        uses these types extensively.  But
        perhaps the most pervasive APR datatype, found in nearly every
        Subversion API prototype, is the
        <literal>apr_pool_t</literal>&#x2014;the APR memory pool.
        Subversion uses pools internally for all its memory allocation
        needs (unless an external library requires a different memory
        management mechanism for data passed through its API),
        <footnote>
          <para>Neon and Berkeley DB are examples of such libraries.</para>
        </footnote>
        and while a person coding against the Subversion APIs is not
        required to do the same, she <emphasis>is</emphasis>
        required to provide pools to the API functions that need them.
        This means that users of the Subversion API must also link
        against APR, must call <function>apr_initialize()</function>
        to initialize the APR subsystem, and then must create and
        manage pools for use with Subversion API calls, typically by
        using <function>svn_pool_create()</function>,
        <function>svn_pool_clear()</function>, and
        <function>svn_pool_destroy()</function>.</para>

        <title>Programming with Memory Pools</title>

        <para>Almost every developer who has used the C programming
          language has at some point sighed at the daunting task of
          managing memory usage.  Allocating enough memory to use,
          keeping track of those allocations, freeing the memory when
          you no longer need it&#x2014;these tasks can be quite
          complex.  And of course, failure to do those things properly
          can result in a program that crashes itself, or worse,
          crashes the computer.</para>

        <para>Higher-level languages, on the other hand, either take
          the job of memory management away from you completely or
          make it something you toy with only when doing extremely
          tight program optimization.  Languages such as Java and
          Python use <firstterm>garbage collection</firstterm>,
          allocating memory for objects when needed, and automatically
          freeing that memory when the object is no longer in
          use.</para>

        <para>APR provides a middle-ground approach called
          <firstterm>pool-based memory management</firstterm>.  It
          allows the developer to control memory usage at a lower
          resolution&#x2014;per chunk (or <quote>pool</quote>) of
          memory, instead of per allocated object.  Rather than using
          <function>malloc()</function> and friends to allocate enough
          memory for a given object, you ask APR to allocate the
          memory from a memory pool.  When you're finished using the
          objects you've created in the pool, you destroy the entire
          pool, effectively de-allocating the memory consumed by
          <emphasis>all</emphasis> the objects you allocated from it.
          Thus, rather than keeping track of individual objects that
          need to be de-allocated, your program simply considers the
          general lifetimes of those objects and allocates the objects
          in a pool whose lifetime (the time between the pool's
          creation and its deletion) matches the object's
          needs.</para>

      <title>URL and Path Requirements</title>

      <para>With remote version control operation as the whole point
        of Subversion's existence, it makes sense that some attention
        has been paid to internationalization (i18n) support.  After
        all, while <quote>remote</quote> might mean <quote>across the
        office,</quote> it could just as well mean <quote>across the
        globe.</quote> To facilitate this, all of Subversion's public
        interfaces that accept path arguments expect those paths to be
        canonicalized&#x2014;which is most easily accomplished by passing
        them through the <function>svn_path_canonicalize()</function>
        function&#x2014;and encoded in UTF-8.  This means, for example, that
        any new client binary that drives the
        <filename>libsvn_client</filename> interface needs to first
        convert paths from the locale-specific encoding to UTF-8
        before passing those paths to the Subversion libraries, and
        then reconvert any resultant output paths from Subversion
        back into the locale's encoding before using those paths for
        non-Subversion purposes.  Fortunately, Subversion provides a
        suite of functions (see
        <filename>subversion/include/svn_utf.h</filename>) that 
        any program can use to do these conversions.</para>

      <para>Also, Subversion APIs require all URL parameters to be
        properly URI-encoded.  So, instead of passing
        <uri>file:///home/username/My File.txt</uri> as the URL of a
        file named <filename>My File.txt</filename>, you need to pass
        <uri>file:///home/username/My%20File.txt</uri>.  Again,
        Subversion supplies helper functions that your application can
        use&#x2014;<function>svn_path_uri_encode()</function> and
        <function>svn_path_uri_decode()</function>, for URI encoding
        and decoding, respectively.</para> </sect2>

      <title>Using Languages Other Than C and C++</title> 

      <para>If you are interested in using the Subversion libraries in
        conjunction with something other than a C program&#x2014;say, a
        Python or Perl script&#x2014;Subversion has some support for this
        via the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG).  The
        SWIG bindings for Subversion are located in
        <filename>subversion/bindings/swig</filename>.  They are still
        maturing, but they are usable.  These bindings allow you
        to call Subversion API functions indirectly, using wrappers that
        translate the datatypes native to your scripting language into
        the datatypes needed by Subversion's C libraries.</para>

      <para>Significant efforts have been made toward creating
        functional SWIG-generated bindings for Python, Perl, and Ruby.
        To some extent, the work done preparing the SWIG interface
        files for these languages is reusable in efforts to generate
        bindings for other languages supported by SWIG (which include
        versions of C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, OCaml, PHP, and Tcl,
        among others).  However, some extra programming is required to
        compensate for complex APIs that SWIG needs some help
        translating between languages.  For more information on SWIG
        itself, see the project's web site at <ulink url="http://www.swig.org/"/>.</para>

      <para>Subversion also has language bindings for Java.  The
        javahl bindings (located in
        <filename>subversion/bindings/java</filename> in the
        Subversion source tree) aren't SWIG-based, but are instead a
        mixture of Java and hand-coded JNI.  Javahl covers most
        Subversion client-side APIs and is specifically targeted at
        implementors of Java-based Subversion clients and IDE
        integrations.</para>

      <para>Subversion's language bindings tend to lack the level of
        developer attention given to the core Subversion modules, but
        can generally be trusted as production-ready.  A number of
        scripts and applications, alternative Subversion GUI clients,
        and other third-party tools are successfully using
        Subversion's language bindings today to accomplish their
        Subversion integrations.</para>

      <para>It's worth noting here that there are other options for
        interfacing with Subversion using other languages:  alternative
        bindings for Subversion that aren't provided by the
        Subversion development community at all.  You can find links
        to these alternative bindings on the Subversion project's
        links page (at <ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html"/>), but there
        are a couple of popular ones we feel are especially
        noteworthy.  First, Barry Scott's PySVN bindings (<ulink url="http://pysvn.tigris.org/"/>) are a popular option for
        binding with Python.  PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic
        interface than the more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's
        own Python bindings.  And if you're looking for a pure Java
        implementation of Subversion, check out SVNKit (<ulink url="http://svnkit.com/"/>), which is Subversion rewritten
        from the ground up in Java.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title>SVNKit Versus javahl</title>

        <para>In 2005, a small company called TMate announced the
          1.0.0 release of JavaSVN&#x2014;a pure Java implementation of
          Subversion.  Since then, the project has been renamed to
          SVNKit (available at <ulink url="http://svnkit.com/"/>)
          and has seen great success as a provider of Subversion
          functionality to various Subversion clients, IDE
          integrations, and other third-party tools.</para>

        <para>The SVNKit library is interesting in that, unlike the
          javahl library, it is not merely a wrapper around the
          official Subversion core libraries.  In fact, it shares no
          code with Subversion at all.  But while it is easy to
          confuse SVNKit with javahl, and easier still to not even
          realize which of these libraries you are using, folks should
          be aware that SVNKit differs from javahl in some significant
          ways.  First, SVNKit is not developed as open source
          software and seems to have at any given time only a few
          developers working on it.  Also, SVNKit's license is more
          restrictive than that of Subversion.  Finally, by aiming to
          be a pure Java Subversion library, SVNKit is limited in
          which portions of Subversion can be reasonably cloned while
          still keeping up with Subversion's releases.  This has
          already happened once&#x2014;SVNKit cannot access BDB-backed
          Subversion repositories via the <literal>file://</literal>
          protocol because there's no pure Java implementation of
          Berkeley DB that is file-format-compatible with the native
          implementation of that library.</para>

        <para>That said, SVNKit has a well-established track record of
          reliability.  And a pure Java solution is much more robust
          in the face of programming errors&#x2014;a bug in SVNKit
          might raise a catchable Java Exception, but a bug in the Subversion core
          libraries as accessed via javahl can bring down your entire
          Java Runtime Environment.  So, weigh the costs when choosing
          a Java-based Subversion implementation.</para>

        memory pool system.  But Python handles memory usage
        automatically, and Subversion's Python bindings adhere to that
        convention.  In C, you'd be working with custom datatypes
        (such as those provided by the APR library) for representing
        the hash of entries and the list of paths, but Python has
        hashes (called <quote>dictionaries</quote>) and lists as
        built-in datatypes, and it provides a rich collection of
        functions for operating on those types.  So SWIG (with the
        help of some customizations in Subversion's language bindings
        layer) takes care of mapping those custom datatypes into the
        native datatypes of the target language.  This provides a more
        intuitive interface for users of that language.</para>

      <para>As was the case in <xref linkend="svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs.ex-1"/>, this

        Python datatypes.  The call to
        <function>svn_client_ctx_t()</function> is deceiving because
        the public Subversion API has no such function&#x2014;this just
        happens to be a case where SWIG's automatic language
        generation bleeds through a little bit (the function is a sort
        of factory function for Python's version of the corresponding
        complex C structure).  Also note that the path passed to this
        program (like the last one) gets run through
        <function>svn_path_canonicalize()</function>, because to
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> do so runs the risk of triggering the
        underlying Subversion C library's assertions about such
        things, which translates into rather immediate and
        unceremonious program abortion.</para>

    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>One of Subversion's greatest features isn't something you
      get from running its command-line client or other tools.  It's
      the fact that Subversion was designed modularly and provides a
      stable, public API so that others&#x2014;like yourself,
      perhaps&#x2014;can write custom software that drives Subversion's
      core logic.</para>

    <para>In this chapter, we took a closer look at Subversion's
      architecture, examining its logical layers and describing that
      public API, the very same API that Subversion's own layers use
      to communicate with each other.  Many developers have found
      interesting uses for the Subversion API, from simple repository
      hook scripts, to integrations between Subversion and some other
      application, to completely different version control systems.
      What unique itch will <emphasis>you</emphasis> scratch with
      it?</para>

  <title>Subversion Complete Reference</title>
  
  <para>This chapter is intended to be a complete reference to using
    Subversion.  This includes the command-line client
    (<command>svn</command>) and all its subcommands, as well as the
    repository administration programs (<command>svnadmin</command>
    and <command>svnlook</command>) and their respective
    subcommands.</para>

    <title>The Subversion Command-Line Client: <command>svn</command></title>
    
    <para>To use the command-line client, type
      <command>svn</command>, the subcommand you wish to use,
      <footnote>
        <para>Well, you don't need a subcommand to use the
          <option>--version</option> option, but we'll get to that in
          just a minute.</para>
      </footnote>
      and any options or targets that you wish to operate on&#x2014;the
      subcommand and the options need not appear in a specific order.
      For example, all of the following are valid ways to
      use <command>svn status</command>:</para>

    <screen>
$ svn -v status
$ svn status -v 
$ svn status -v myfile
</screen>

    <para>You can find many more examples of how to use most client
      commands in <xref linkend="svn.tour"/> and commands for managing
      properties in <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props"/>.</para>

      <title>svn Options</title> 
      
      <para>While Subversion has different options for its
        subcommands, all options exist in a single
        namespace&#x2014;that is, each option is guaranteed to mean the
        same thing regardless of the subcommand you use it with.  For
        example, <option>--verbose</option> (<option>-v</option>)
        always means <quote>verbose output,</quote> regardless of the
        subcommand you use it with.</para>

      <para>The <command>svn</command> command-line client usually
        exits quickly with an error if you pass it an option which
        does not apply to the specified subcommand.  But as of
        Subversion 1.5, several of the options which apply to
        all&#x2014;or nearly all&#x2014;of the subcommands have been
        deemed acceptable by all subcommands, even if they have no
        effect on some of them.  They appear grouped together in the
        command-line client's usage messages as global options.  This
        was done to assist folks who write scripts which wrap the
        command-line client.  These global options are as
        follows:</para>

          <para>When adding a directory, the default behavior of

          <para>You can add a directory without adding its

          <screen>
$ svn add --depth=empty otherdir
A         otherdir
</screen>

          <para>Normally, the command <userinput>svn add *</userinput>
            will skip over any directories that are already under
            version control.  Sometimes, however, you may want to add
            every unversioned object in your working copy, including
            those hiding deeper.  Passing the
            <option>--force</option> option makes <command>svn
            add</command> recurse into versioned directories:
          </para>

          <para>Send changes from your working copy to the
            repository.  If you do not supply a log message with your
            commit by using either the <option>--file</option> or
            <option>--message</option> option,
            <command>svn</command> will launch your editor for you
            to compose a commit message.  See the
            <literal>editor-cmd</literal> list entry in <xref linkend="svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config"/>.</para>

          <para><command>svn commit</command> will send any lock
            tokens that it finds and will release locks on all
            <replaceable>PATH</replaceable>s committed (recursively)
            unless <option>--no-unlock</option> is passed.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>If you begin a commit and Subversion launches your
              editor to compose the commit message, you can still
              abort without committing your changes.  If you want to
              cancel your commit, just quit your editor without saving
              your commit message and Subversion will prompt you to
              either abort the commit, continue with no message, or
              edit the message again.</para>

          <para>Shows log messages from the repository.
            If no arguments are supplied, <command>svn
            log</command> shows the log messages for all files and
            directories inside (and including) the current working
            directory of your working copy.  You can refine the
            results by specifying a path, one or more revisions, or
            any combination of the two.  The default revision range
            for a local path is <literal>BASE:1</literal>.</para>

          <para>If you specify a URL alone, it prints log
            messages for everything the URL contains.  If you
            add paths past the URL, only messages for those paths
            under that URL will be printed.  The default revision range
            for a URL is <literal>HEAD:1</literal>.</para>

          <para>With <option>--verbose</option>, <command>svn log</command>
            will also print all affected paths with each log message.
            With <option>--quiet</option>, <command>svn log</command>
            will not print the log message body itself (this is
            compatible with <option>--verbose</option>).</para>

          <para>Each log message is printed just once, even if more
            than one of the affected paths for that revision were
            explicitly requested.  Logs follow copy history by
            default.  Use <option>--stop-on-copy</option> to disable
            this behavior, which can be useful for determining branch
            points.</para>

          <para>In addition to the action codes which precede the
            changed paths, <command>svn log</command> with the <option>--verbose</option> option will
            note whether a path was added or replaced as the result of a copy
            operation.  It does so by printing <literal>(from
            <replaceable>COPY-FROM-PATH</replaceable>:<replaceable>COPY-FROM-REV</replaceable>)</literal>
            after such paths.</para>

          <para>When you're concatenating the results of multiple
            calls to the log command, you may want to use the
            <option>--incremental</option> option. <command>svn
            log</command> normally prints out a dashed line at the
            beginning of a log message, after each subsequent log
            message, and following the final log message.  If you
            ran <command>svn log</command> on a range of two
            revisions, you would get this:</para>
          <screen>
$ svn log -r 14:15
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r15 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</screen>

          <para>However, if you wanted to gather two nonsequential log
            messages into a file, you might do something like
            this:</para>

          <screen>
$ svn log -r 14 &gt; mylog
$ svn log -r 19 &gt;&gt; mylog
$ svn log -r 27 &gt;&gt; mylog
$ cat mylog
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r19 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r27 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
</screen>

          <para>You can avoid the clutter of the double dashed lines
            in your output by using the <option>--incremental</option>
            option:</para>

          <screen>
$ svn log --incremental -r 14 &gt; mylog
$ svn log --incremental -r 19 &gt;&gt; mylog
$ svn log --incremental -r 27 &gt;&gt; mylog
$ cat mylog
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r14 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r19 | &#x2026;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r27 | &#x2026;
</screen>

          <para>The <option>--incremental</option> option provides
            similar output control when using the
            <option>--xml</option> option:</para>

          <screen>
$ svn log --xml --incremental -r 1 sandwich.txt
&lt;logentry
   revision="1"&gt;
&lt;author&gt;harry&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2008-06-03T06:35:53.048870Z&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;msg&gt;Initial Import.&lt;/msg&gt;
&lt;/logentry&gt;
</screen>

          <tip>
            <para>Sometimes when you run <command>svn log</command> on
              a specific path and a specific revision, you see no log
              information output at all, as in the following:</para>

            <screen>
$ svn log -r 20 http://svn.red-bean.com/untouched.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</screen>

            <para>That just means the path wasn't modified in that
              revision.  To get log information for that revision,
              either run the log operation against the repository's
              root URL, or specify a path that you happen to know was
              changed in that revision:</para>
            
            <screen>
$ svn log -r 20 touched.txt

          <title>Description</title>

          <para>In the first form, the source URLs are specified at
            revisions <replaceable>N</replaceable> and <replaceable>M</replaceable>.
            These are the two sources to be compared.  The revisions
            default to <literal>HEAD</literal> if omitted.</para>

          <para>In the second form, the URLs corresponding to the
            source working copy paths define the sources to be
            compared.  The revisions must be specified.</para>

          <para>In the third form, <replaceable>SOURCE</replaceable>
            can be either a URL or a working copy path (in which case
            its corresponding URL is used).  If not specified,
            <replaceable>SOURCE</replaceable> will be the same as
            <replaceable>WCPATH</replaceable>.
            <replaceable>SOURCE</replaceable> in revision
            <replaceable>REV</replaceable> is compared as it existed
            between revisions <replaceable>N</replaceable> and
            <replaceable>M</replaceable> for each revision range
            provided.  If <replaceable>REV</replaceable> is not
            specified, <literal>HEAD</literal> is assumed.</para>

          <para><literal>-c M</literal> is equivalent to <literal>-r
            &lt;M-1&gt;:M</literal>, and <literal>-c -M</literal> does
            the reverse: <literal>-r M:&lt;M-1&gt;</literal>.  If no
            revision ranges are specified, the default range of
            <literal>1:HEAD</literal> is used.  Multiple
            <literal>-c</literal> and/or <literal>-r</literal>
            instances may be specified, and mixing of forward and
            reverse ranges is allowed&#x2014;the ranges are internally
            compacted to their minimum representation before merging
            begins (which may result in no-op).</para>

          <para><replaceable>WCPATH</replaceable> is the working copy
            path that will receive the changes.  If
            <replaceable>WCPATH</replaceable> is omitted, a default
            value of <quote><filename>.</filename></quote> is assumed,
            unless the sources have identical basenames that match a
            file within <quote><filename>.</filename></quote>.  In
            this case, the differences will be applied to that
            file.</para>

          <para>Subversion will internally track metadata about
            the merge operation only if the two sources are ancestrally
            related&#x2014;if the first source is an ancestor of the
            second or vice versa.  This is guaranteed to be the case
            when using the third form.  Unlike <command>svn
            diff</command>, the merge command takes the ancestry of a
            file into consideration when performing a merge operation.
            This is very important when you're merging changes from
            one branch into another and you've renamed a file on one
            branch but not the other.</para>

          <para>This is the easiest way to find out what changes you

          <screen>
$ svn status wc
 M     wc/bar.c
A  +   wc/qax.c
</screen>

          <para>If you want to find out what files in your working
            copy are out of date, pass the
            <option>--show-updates</option> option (this will
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> make any changes to your
            working copy).  Here you can see that
            <filename>wc/foo.c</filename> has changed in the
            repository since we last updated our working
            copy:</para>

          <screen>
$ svn status --show-updates wc
 M           965    wc/bar.c
       *     965    wc/foo.c

          <note>
            <para><option>--show-updates</option>
              <emphasis>only</emphasis> places an asterisk next to
              items that are out of date (i.e., items that will be
              updated from the repository if you later use <command>svn
              update</command>).  <option>--show-updates</option> does
              <emphasis>not</emphasis> cause the status listing to
              reflect the repository's version of the item (although
              you can see the revision number in the repository by
              passing the <option>--verbose</option> option).</para>
          </note>

          <para>The most information you can get out of

          <title>Description</title>

          <para>The first variant of this subcommand (without the
            <option>--relocate</option> option) updates your working
            copy to point to a new URL&#x2014;usually a URL that
            shares a common ancestor with your working copy, although
            not necessarily.  This is the Subversion way to move a
            working copy to a new branch.  If specified,
            <replaceable>PEGREV</replaceable> determines in which
            revision the target is first looked up.  See <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge.switchwc"/> for an in-depth look
            at switching.</para>

          <para>If <option>--force</option> is used, unversioned
            obstructing paths in the working copy do not automatically
            cause a failure if the switch attempts to add the same
            path.  If the obstructing path is the same type (file or
            directory) as the corresponding path in the repository, it
            becomes versioned but its contents are left untouched in
            the working copy.  This means that an obstructing
            directory's unversioned children may also obstruct and
            become versioned.  For files, any content differences
            between the obstruction and the repository are treated
            like a local modification to the working copy.  All
            properties from the repository are applied to the
            obstructing path.</para>

          <para>As with most subcommands, you can limit the scope of
            the switch operation to a particular tree depth using the
            <option>--depth</option> option.  Alternatively, you can
            use the <option>--set-depth</option> option to set a new
            <quote>sticky</quote> working copy depth on the switch
            target.  Currently, the depth of a working copy directory
            can only be increased (telescoped more deeply); you cannot
            make a directory more shallow.</para>

          <para>The <option>--relocate</option> option causes
            <command>svn switch</command> to do something different:
            it updates your working copy to point to <emphasis>the
            same</emphasis> repository directory, only at a different
            URL (typically because an administrator has moved the
            repository to another server, or to another URL on the
            same server).</para>

            <filename>vendors</filename>, which was branched to
            <filename>vendors-with-fix</filename>, and you'd like to

          <para>To switch back, just provide the URL to the

          <tip>
            <para>You can switch just part of your working copy to a
              branch if you don't want to switch your entire working
              copy.</para>
          </tip>

          <para>Sometimes an administrator might change the location
            (or apparent location) of your repository&#x2014;in other
            words, the content of the repository doesn't change, but
            the repository's root URL does.  For example, the hostname
            may change, the URL scheme may change, or any part of the
            URL that leads to the repository itself may change.
            Rather than check out a new working copy, you can have the
            <command>svn switch</command> command
            <quote>rewrite</quote> your working copy's administrative
            metadata to refer to the new repository location.  If you
            use the <option>--relocate</option> option to <command>svn
            switch</command>, Subversion will contact the repository
            to validate the relocation request (looking for the
            repository at the new URL, of course), and then do this
            metadata rewriting.  No file contents will be changed as
            the result of this type of switch operation&#x2014;this is
            a metadata-only modification to the working copy.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>Be careful when using the
            <option>--relocate</option> option.  If you mistype the
            argument, you might end up creating nonsensical URLs
            within your working copy that render the whole workspace
            unusable and tricky to fix.  It's also important to
            understand exactly when one should or shouldn't use
            <option>--relocate</option>.  Here's the rule of

          <para>Two useful options modify the dump file
            generator's behavior.  The first is the
            <option>--incremental</option> option, which simply causes
            that first revision in the dump stream to contain only
            the files and directories modified in that revision,
            instead of being presented as the addition of a new tree,
            and in exactly the same way that every other revision in
            the dump file is presented.  This is useful for generating
            a relatively small dump file to be loaded into another
            repository that already has the files and directories
            that exist in the original repository.</para>

          <para>The second useful option is <option>--deltas</option>.
            This option causes <command>svnadmin dump</command> to,
            instead of emitting full-text representations of file
            contents and property lists, emit only deltas of those
            items against their previous versions.  This reduces (in
            some cases, drastically) the size of the dump file that
            <command>svnadmin dump</command> creates.  There are, however,
            disadvantages to using this option&#x2014;deltified
            dump files are more CPU-intensive to create, cannot be
            operated on by <command>svndumpfilter</command>, and tend
            not to compress as well as their nondeltified counterparts
            when using third-party tools such as <command>gzip</command>
            and <command>bzip2</command>.</para>

    <para><command>svnlook</command> is a command-line utility for

      <command>svnlook</command> is typically used by the

      (and thus can be used only on the machine that holds the
      repository), it refers to the repository with a path, not a URL.</para>

    <title>svnsync</title>
    
    <para><command>svnsync</command> is the Subversion remote
      repository mirroring tool.  Put simply, it allows you to replay
      the revisions of one repository into another one.</para>

    <para>In any mirroring scenario, there are two repositories: the
      source repository, and the mirror (or <quote>sink</quote>)
      repository.  The source repository is the repository from which
      <command>svnsync</command> pulls revisions.  The mirror
      repository is the destination for the revisions pulled from the
      source repository.  Each of the repositories may be local or
      remote&#x2014;they are only ever addressed by their URLs.</para>

    <para>The <command>svnsync</command> process requires only read
      access to the source repository; it never attempts to modify it.
      But obviously, <command>svnsync</command> requires both read and
      write access to the mirror repository.</para>

    <warning>
      <para><command>svnsync</command> is very sensitive to changes
        made in the mirror repository that weren't made as part of a
        mirroring operation.  To prevent this from happening, it's
        best if the <command>svnsync</command> process is the only
        process permitted to modify the mirror repository.</para>

          <title>Description</title>

          <para>Because Subversion revision properties can be changed
            at any time, it's possible that the properties for some
            revision might be changed after that revision has already
            been synchronized to another repository.  Because the
            <command>svnsync synchronize</command> command operates
            only on the range of revisions that have not yet been
            synchronized, it won't notice a revision property change
            outside that range.  Left as is, this causes a deviation
            in the values of that revision's properties between the
            source and mirror repositories.  <command>svnsync
            copy-revprops</command> is the answer to this problem.
            Use it to resynchronize the revision properties for a
            particular revision or range of revisions.</para>

    <para><command>svnserve</command> allows access to Subversion
      repositories using Subversion's custom network protocol.</para>

    <para>You can run <command>svnserve</command> as a standalone
      server process (for clients that are using the
      <literal>svn://</literal> access method); you can have a daemon
      such as <command>inetd</command> or <command>xinetd</command>
      launch it for you on demand (also for
      <literal>svn://</literal>), or you can have
      <command>sshd</command> launch it on demand for the
      <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> access method.</para>

    <para>Regardless of the access method, once the client has
      selected a repository by transmitting its URL,
      <command>svnserve</command> reads a file named
      <filename>conf/svnserve.conf</filename> in the repository
      directory to determine repository-specific settings such as
      what authentication database to use and what authorization
      policies to apply.  See <xref linkend="svn.serverconfig.svnserve"/> for details of the
      <filename>svnserve.conf</filename> file.</para>

            <listitem>

              <para>Toggles support for all-inclusive
                responses to update-style <literal>REPORT</literal>
                requests.  Subversion clients use
                <literal>REPORT</literal> requests to get information
                about directory tree checkouts and updates from
                <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.  They can ask the
                server to send that information in one of two ways:
                with the entirety of the tree's information in one
                massive response, or with a
                <firstterm>skelta</firstterm> (a skeletal
                representation of a tree delta) which contains just
                enough information for the client to know what
                <emphasis>additional</emphasis> data to request from
                the server.  When this directive is included with a
                value of <literal>Off</literal>,
                <command>mod_dav_svn</command> will only ever respond
                to these <literal>REPORT</literal> requests with
                skelta responses, regardless of the type of responses
                requested by the client.</para>

              <para>Most folks won't need to use this directive at
                all.  It primarily exists for administrators who
                wish&#x2014;for security or auditing reasons&#x2014;to
                force Subversion clients to fetch individually all the
                files and directories needed for updates and
                checkouts, thus leaving an audit trail of
                <literal>GET</literal> and <literal>PROPFIND</literal>
                requests in Apache's logs.  The default value of this
                directive is <literal>On</literal>.</para>

              <para>When its value is
                <literal>On</literal>, allows write requests from
                WebDAV clients to result in automatic commits.  A
                generic log message is auto-generated and attached to
                each revision.  If you enable autoversioning, you'll
                likely want to set <literal>ModMimeUsePathInfo
                On</literal> so that <literal>mod_mime</literal> can
                set <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> to the correct
                MIME type automatically (as best as
                <literal>mod_mime</literal> is able to, of course).

  <title>Subversion Quick-Start Guide</title>


  <para>If you're eager to get Subversion up and running (and you
    enjoy learning by experimentation), this appendix will show you how
    to create a repository, import code, and then check it back out
    again as a working copy.  Along the way, we give links to the
    relevant chapters of this book.</para>

  <warning>
  <para>If you're new to the entire concept of version control or to
    the <quote>copy-modify-merge</quote> model used by both CVS and
    Subversion, you should read <xref linkend="svn.basic"/>
    before going any further.</para>

    <title>Installing Subversion</title>

    <para>Subversion is built on a portability layer called
      APR&#x2014;the Apache Portable Runtime library.  The APR library
      provides all the interfaces that Subversion needs to function on
      different operating systems: disk access, network access, memory
      management, and so on.  While Subversion is able to use Apache
      as one of its network server programs, its dependence on APR
      <emphasis>does not</emphasis> mean that Apache is a required
      component.  APR is a standalone library usable by any
      application.  It does mean, however, that like Apache,
      Subversion clients and servers run on any operating system that
      the Apache <command>httpd</command> server runs on: Windows,
      Linux, all flavors of BSD, Mac OS X, NetWare, and others.</para>

    <para>The easiest way to get Subversion is to download a binary
      package built for your operating system.  Subversion's web site
      (<ulink url="http://subversion.tigris.org"/>) often has these
      packages available for download, posted by volunteers.  The site
      usually contains graphical installer packages for users of
      Microsoft operating systems.  If you run a Unix-like operating
      system, you can use your system's native package distribution
      system (RPMs, DEBs, the ports tree, etc.) to get
      Subversion.</para>

    <para>Alternatively, you can build Subversion directly from source
      code, though it's not always an easy task. (If you're not
      experienced at building open source software packages, you're
      probably better off downloading a binary distribution instead!)
      From the Subversion web site, download the latest source code
      release.  After unpacking it, follow the instructions in
      the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file to build it.  Note that a
      released source package may not contain everything you need to
      build a command-line client capable of talking to a remote
      repository.  Starting with Subversion 1.4 and later, the
      libraries Subversion depends on (apr, apr-util, and neon) are
      distributed in a separate source package suffixed
      with <filename>-deps</filename>.  These libraries are now common
      enough that they may already be installed on your system.  If
      not, you'll need to unpack the dependency package into the same
      directory where you unpacked the main Subversion source.
      Regardless, it's possible that you may want to fetch other
      optional dependencies such as Berkeley DB and possibly Apache
      <command>httpd</command>.  If you want to do a complete build,
      make sure you have all of the packages documented in
      the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file.</para>

    <para>If you're one of those folks that likes to use bleeding-edge
      software, you can also get the Subversion source code from the
      Subversion repository in which it lives.  Obviously, you'll need
      to already have a Subversion client on hand to do this.  But
      once you do, you can check out a working copy of the Subversion source
      repository from <ulink url="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/"/>:
      <footnote>
        <para>Note that the URL checked out in the example ends not
          with <literal>svn</literal>, but with a subdirectory thereof
          called <literal>trunk</literal>.  See our discussion of
          Subversion's branching and tagging model for the reasoning
          behind this.</para>
      </footnote>
    </para>

    <screen>
$ svn checkout http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk subversion
A    subversion/HACKING
A    subversion/INSTALL
A    subversion/README
A    subversion/autogen.sh
A    subversion/build.conf
&#x2026;
</screen>

    <para>The preceding command will create a working copy of the
      latest (unreleased) Subversion source code into a subdirectory
      named <filename>subversion</filename> in your current working
      directory.  You can adjust that last argument as you see fit.
      Regardless of what you call the new working copy directory,
      though, after this operation completes, you will now have the
      Subversion source code.  Of course, you will still need to fetch
      a few helper libraries (apr, apr-util, etc.)&#x2014;see the
      <filename>INSTALL</filename> file in the top level of the
      working copy for details.</para>

        </blockquote>

    <para>What follows is a quick tutorial that walks you through some
      basic Subversion configuration and operation.  When you finish
      it, you should have a general understanding of Subversion's
      typical usage.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The examples used in this appendix assume that you have
        <command>svn</command>, the Subversion command-line client,
        and <command>svnadmin</command>, the administrative tool,
        ready to go on a Unix-like operating system.  (This tutorial
        also works at the Windows command-line prompt, assuming you
        make some obvious tweaks.)  We also assume you are using
        Subversion 1.2 or later (run <userinput>svn --version</userinput>
        to check.)</para>
    </note>

    <para>Subversion stores all versioned data in a central
      repository.  To begin, create a new repository:</para>

    <screen>
$ svnadmin create /var/svn/repos
$ ls /var/svn/repos
conf/  dav/  db/  format  hooks/  locks/  README.txt
</screen>

    <para>This command creates a new directory,
      <filename>/var/svn/repos</filename>, which contains a Subversion
      repository.  This new directory contains (among other things) a
      collection of database files.  You won't see your versioned
      files if you peek inside.  For more information about repository
      creation and maintenance, see <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin"/>.</para>

    <para>Subversion has no concept of a <quote>project.</quote> The
      repository is just a virtual versioned filesystem, a large tree
      that can hold anything you wish.  Some administrators prefer to
      store only one project in a repository, and others prefer to
      store multiple projects in a repository by placing them into
      separate directories.  We discuss the merits of each approach
      in <xref linkend="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"/>.
      Either way, the repository manages only files and directories,
      so it's up to humans to interpret particular directories as
      <quote>projects.</quote>  So while you might see references to
      projects throughout this book, keep in mind that we're only ever
      talking about some directory (or collection of directories) in
      the repository.</para>

    <para>In this example, we assume you already have some sort
      of project (a collection of files and directories) that you wish
      to import into your newly created Subversion repository.  Begin
      by organizing your data into a single directory called
      <filename>myproject</filename> (or whatever you wish).  For
      reasons explained in <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>, your
      project's tree structure should contain three top-level
      directories named <filename>branches</filename>,
      <filename>tags</filename>, and <filename>trunk</filename>.  The
      <filename>trunk</filename> directory should contain all of your
      data, and the <filename>branches</filename> and
      <filename>tags</filename> directories should be empty:</para>

    <screen>
/tmp/myproject/branches/
/tmp/myproject/tags/
/tmp/myproject/trunk/
                     foo.c
                     bar.c
                     Makefile
                     &#x2026;
</screen>

    <para>The <filename>branches</filename>, <filename>tags</filename>,
      and <filename>trunk</filename> subdirectories aren't actually
      required by Subversion.  They're merely a popular convention
      that you'll most likely want to use later on.</para>

    <para>Once you have your tree of data ready to go, import it into
      the repository with the <command>svn import</command> command
      (see <xref linkend="svn.tour.importing"/>):</para>

    <screen>
$ svn import /tmp/myproject file:///var/svn/repos/myproject -m "initial import"
Adding         /tmp/myproject/branches
Adding         /tmp/myproject/tags
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/foo.c
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/bar.c
Adding         /tmp/myproject/trunk/Makefile
&#x2026;
Committed revision 1.
$ 
</screen>

    <para>Now the repository contains this tree of data.  As mentioned
      earlier, you won't see your files by directly peeking into the
      repository;  they're all stored within a database.  But the
      repository's imaginary filesystem now contains a top-level
      directory named <filename>myproject</filename>, which in turn
      contains your data.</para>

    <para>Note that the original <filename>/tmp/myproject</filename>
      directory is unchanged; Subversion is unaware of it.  (In fact,
      you can even delete that directory if you wish.)  To
      start manipulating repository data, you need to create a new
      <quote>working copy</quote> of the data, a sort of private
      workspace.  Ask Subversion to <quote>check out</quote> a working
      copy of the <filename>myproject/trunk</filename> directory in

  <title>Subversion for CVS Users</title>

  <para>This appendix is a guide for CVS users new to Subversion.
    It's essentially a list of differences between the two systems
    as <quote>viewed from 10,000 feet.</quote>  For each section, we
    provide references to relevant chapters when
    possible.</para>

  <para>Although the goal of Subversion is to take over the current
    and future CVS user base, some new features and design changes
    were required to fix certain <quote>broken</quote> behaviors
    that CVS had.  This means that, as a CVS user, you may need to
    break habits&#x2014;ones that you forgot were odd to begin

  <sect1 id="svn.forcvs.revnums">
    <title>Revision Numbers Are Different Now</title>

    <para>In CVS, revision numbers are per file.  This is because CVS
      stores its data in RCS files; each file has a corresponding RCS
      file in the repository, and the repository is roughly laid out
      according to the structure of your project tree.</para>

    <para>In Subversion, the repository looks like a single
      filesystem.  Each commit results in an entirely new filesystem
      tree; in essence, the repository is an array of trees.  Each of
      these trees is labeled with a single revision number.  When
      someone talks about <quote>revision 54</quote>, he's talking
      about a particular tree (and indirectly, the way the filesystem
      looked after the 54th commit).</para>

    <para>Technically, it's not valid to talk about <quote>revision 5
      of <filename>foo.c</filename>.</quote>  Instead, one would say
      <quote><filename>foo.c</filename> as it appears in revision
      5.</quote>  Also, be careful when making assumptions about the
      evolution of a file.  In CVS, revisions 5 and 6 of
      <filename>foo.c</filename> are always different.  In Subversion,
      it's most likely that <filename>foo.c</filename> did
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> change between revisions 5 and
      6.</para>

    <para>Similarly, in CVS, a tag or branch is an annotation on the
      file or on the version information for that individual file,
      whereas in Subversion, a tag or branch is a copy of an entire
      tree (by convention, into the <filename>/branches</filename>
      or <filename>/tags</filename> directories that appear at the top
      level of the repository, beside <filename>/trunk</filename>). In
      the repository as a whole, many versions of each file may be
      visible: the latest version on each branch, every tagged
      version, and of course the latest version on the trunk
      itself. So, to refine the terms even further, one would often
      say <quote><filename>foo.c</filename> as it appears in
      <filename>/branches/REL1</filename> in revision
      5.</quote></para>

    <title>Directory Versions</title>
    
    <para>Subversion tracks tree structures, not just file contents.
      It's one of the biggest reasons Subversion was written to
      replace CVS.</para>

    <para>Here's what this means to you, as a former CVS user:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <command>svn add</command> and <command>svn
          delete</command> commands work on directories now, just as
          they work on files.  So do <command>svn copy</command> and
          <command>svn move</command>.  However, these commands do
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> cause any kind of immediate change
          in the repository.  Instead, the working items are simply
          <quote>scheduled</quote> for addition or deletion.  No
          repository changes happen until you run <userinput>svn
          commit</userinput>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Directories aren't dumb containers anymore; they have
          revision numbers like files.  (Or more properly, it's
          correct to talk about <quote>directory
          <filename>foo/</filename> in revision 5.</quote>)</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Let's talk more about that last point.  Directory versioning
      is a hard problem; because we want to allow mixed-revision
      working copies, there are some limitations on how far we can
      abuse this model.</para>

    <para>From a theoretical point of view, we define <quote>revision
      5 of directory <filename>foo</filename></quote> to mean a
      specific collection of directory entries and properties.  Now
      suppose we start adding and removing files from
      <filename>foo</filename>, and then commit.  It would be a lie
      to say that we still have revision 5 of
      <filename>foo</filename>.  However, if we bumped
      <filename>foo</filename>'s revision number after the commit,
      that would be a lie too; there may be other changes to
      <filename>foo</filename> we haven't yet received, because we
      haven't updated yet.</para>
    
    <para>Subversion deals with this problem by quietly tracking
      committed adds and deletes in the <filename>.svn</filename>
      area.  When you eventually run <userinput>svn update</userinput>,
      all accounts are settled with the repository, and the
      directory's new revision number is set correctly.
      <emphasis>Therefore, only after an update is it truly safe to
      say that you have a <quote>perfect</quote> revision of a
      directory.</emphasis> Most of the time, your working copy will
      contain <quote>imperfect</quote> directory revisions.</para>
    
    <para>Similarly, a problem arises if you attempt to commit
      property changes on a directory.  Normally, the commit would
      bump the working directory's local revision number.  But again,
      that would be a lie, as there may be adds or deletes that
      the directory doesn't yet have, because no update has happened.
      <emphasis>Therefore, you are not allowed to commit
      property changes on a directory unless the directory is
      up to date.</emphasis></para>

      versioning, see <xref linkend="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs"/>.</para>

    <title>More Disconnected Operations</title>

    <para>In recent years, disk space has become outrageously cheap
      and abundant, but network bandwidth has not.  Therefore, the
      Subversion working copy has been optimized around the scarcer
      resource.</para>

    <para>The <filename>.svn</filename> administrative directory
      serves the same purpose as the <filename>CVS</filename>

    <para>The last subcommand in the list&#x2014;<command>svn
      revert</command>&#x2014;is new.  It will not only remove local
      changes, but also unschedule operations such as adds and
      deletes.  Although deleting the file and then running <userinput>svn
      update</userinput> will still work, doing so distorts the true
      purpose of updating.  And, while we're on this subject&#x2026;

    <title>Distinction Between Status and Update</title>

    <para>Subversion attempts to erase a lot of the confusion
      between the <command>cvs status</command> and
      <command>cvs update</command> commands.</para>

    <para>The <command>cvs status</command> command has two purposes:
      first, to show the user any local modifications in the working
      copy, and second, to show the user which files are out of date.
      Unfortunately, because of CVS's hard-to-read status output, many
      CVS users don't take advantage of this command at all.  Instead,
      they've developed a habit of running <userinput>cvs
      update</userinput> or <userinput>cvs -n update</userinput> to quickly
      see their changes.  If users forget to use
      the <option>-n</option> option, this has the side effect of
      merging repository changes they may not be ready to deal
      with.</para>

    <para>Subversion removes this muddle by making the output of
      <command>svn status</command> easy to read for both humans and
      parsers.  Also, <command>svn update</command> prints only
      information about files that are updated,
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> local modifications.</para>

    <sect2 id="svn.forcvs.status-vs-update.status">
      <title>Status</title>

      <para><command>svn status</command> prints all files that have
        local modifications.  By default, the repository is not
        contacted.  While this subcommand accepts a fair number of
        options, the following are the most commonly used ones:</para>

        <varlistentry>

          <listitem>

          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>The <command>svn status</command> command has two output
        formats.  In the default <quote>short</quote> format, local
        modifications look like this:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status
M      foo.c
M      bar/baz.c
</screen>

      <para>If you specify the <option>--show-updates</option>
        (<option>-u</option>) option, a longer output format is
        used:</para>

      <screen>
$ svn status -u
M            1047   foo.c
       *     1045   faces.html
       *            bloo.png
M            1050   bar/baz.c
Status against revision:   1066
</screen>

      <para>In this case, two new columns appear.  The second column
        contains an asterisk if the file or directory is out of date.
        The third column shows the working copy's revision number of the
        item.  In the previous example, the asterisk indicates that
        <filename>faces.html</filename> would be patched if we updated,
        and that <filename>bloo.png</filename> is a newly added file in
        the repository.  (The absence of any revision number next to
        <filename>bloo.png</filename> means that it doesn't yet exist in
        the working copy.)</para>

      <!-- ###TODO describe -v here as well as -uv. -u and -v use
           different <quote>long</quote> formats and need to be
           documented separately.  Moreover, as you can combine -u and
           -v, it needs to be explained what each of them does.  As -u is
           much more important than -v, and the example following that
           paragraph *is* about -u, not -v, my patch concentrated on
           that. -->

      <para>At this point, you should take a quick look at the list of
        all possible status codes in
        <xref linkend="svn.ref.svn.c.status"/>.  Here are a few of the
        more common status codes you'll see:</para>

      <screen>
A    Resource is scheduled for Addition
D    Resource is scheduled for Deletion
M    Resource has local Modifications
C    Resource has Conflicts (changes have not been completely merged
       between the repository and working copy version)
X    Resource is eXternal to this working copy (may come from another
       repository).  See <xref linkend="svn.advanced.externals"/>

    <title>Branches and Tags</title>

    <para>Subversion doesn't distinguish between filesystem space and
      <quote>branch</quote> space; branches and tags are ordinary
      directories within the filesystem.  This is probably the single
      biggest mental hurdle that a CVS user will need to cross.  Read
      all about it in <xref linkend="svn.branchmerge"/>.</para>

    <warning>

      <para>Since Subversion treats branches and tags as ordinary
        directories, your project's various lines of development
        probably live in subdirectories of the main project directory.
        So remember to check out using the URL of the subdirectory
        that contains the particular line of development you want, not
        the project's root URL.  If you make the mistake of checking
        out the root of the project, you may very well wind up with a
        working copy that contains a complete copy of your project's
        content for each and every one of its branches and tags.

  <sect1 id="svn.forcvs.conflicts">
    <title>Conflict Resolution</title>

    <para>CVS marks conflicts with inline <quote>conflict
      markers,</quote> and then prints a <literal>C</literal> during
      an update or merge operation.  Historically, this has caused
      problems, because CVS isn't doing enough.  Many users forget
      about (or don't see) the <literal>C</literal> after it whizzes
      by on their terminal.  They often forget that the conflict
      markers are even present, and then accidentally commit files
      containing those conflict markers.</para>

    <para>Subversion solves this problem in a pair of ways.  First,
      when a conflict occurs in a file, Subversion records the fact
      that the file is in a state of conflict, and won't allow you to
      commit changes to that file until you explicitly resolve the
      conflict.  Second, Subversion 1.5 provides interactive
      conflict resolution, which allows you to resolve conflicts as
      they happen instead of having to go back and do so after the
      update or merge operation completes.  See <xref linkend="svn.tour.cycle.resolve"/> for more about conflict
      resolution in Subversion.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.forcvs.binary-and-trans">
    <title>Binary Files and Translation</title>

    <para>In the most general sense, Subversion handles binary files
      more gracefully than CVS does.  Because CVS uses RCS, it can
      only store successive full copies of a changing binary file.
      Subversion, however, expresses differences between files using a
      binary differencing algorithm, regardless of whether they
      contain textual or binary data.  That means all files are
      stored differentially (compressed) in the repository.</para>
    
    <para>CVS users have to mark binary files with
      <option>-kb</option> flags to prevent data from being
      garbled (due to keyword expansion and line-ending translations).
      They sometimes forget to do this.</para>

    <para>Subversion takes the more paranoid route.  First, it never
      performs any kind of keyword or line-ending translation unless
      you explicitly ask it to do so (see <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.keywords"/> and <xref linkend="svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style"/> for more details).  By default,
      Subversion treats all file data as literal byte strings, and
      files are always stored in the repository in an untranslated
      state.</para>

    <para>Second, Subversion maintains an internal notion of whether a
      file is <quote>text</quote> or <quote>binary</quote> data, but
      this notion is <emphasis>only</emphasis> extant in the working
      copy.  During an <command>svn update</command>, Subversion will
      perform contextual merges on locally modified text files, but
      will not attempt to do so for binary files.</para>

    <para>To determine whether a contextual merge is possible,
      Subversion examines the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
      property.  If the file has no <literal>svn:mime-type</literal>
      property, or has a MIME type that is textual (e.g.,
      <literal>text/*</literal>),
      Subversion assumes it is text.  Otherwise, Subversion assumes
      the file is binary.  Subversion also helps users by running a
      binary-detection algorithm in the <command>svn import</command>
      and <command>svn add</command> commands.  These commands will
      make a good guess and then (possibly) set a binary
      <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on the file being
      added.  (If Subversion guesses wrong, the user can always remove
      or hand-edit the property.)</para>

      <command>svnserve</command> as the server, you don't provide any
      authentication credentials at the outset&#x2014;if an operation
      that you perform requires authentication, the server will
      challenge you for your credentials (whether those credentials
      are username and password, a client certificate, or even both).
      So if your repository is world-readable, you will not be
      required to authenticate at all for read operations.</para>

    <para>As with CVS, Subversion still caches your credentials on
      disk (in your <filename>~/.subversion/auth/</filename>
      directory) unless you tell it not to by using the
      <option>--no-auth-cache</option> option.</para>

    <para>The exception to this behavior, however, is in the case of
      accessing an <command>svnserve</command> server over an SSH
      tunnel, using the <literal>svn+ssh://</literal> URL scheme.  In
      that case, the <command>ssh</command> program unconditionally
      demands authentication just to start the tunnel.</para>

    <title>Converting a Repository from CVS to Subversion</title>

    <para>Perhaps the most important way to familiarize CVS users with
      Subversion is to let them continue to work on their projects
      using the new system.  And while that can be somewhat
      accomplished using a flat import into a Subversion repository of
      an exported CVS repository, the more thorough solution involves
      transferring not just the latest snapshot of their data, but all
      the history behind it as well, from one system to another.  This
      is an extremely difficult problem to solve; it involves
      deducing changesets in the absence of atomicity and translating
      between the systems' completely orthogonal branching policies,
      among other complications.  Still, a handful of tools claim
      to at least partially support the ability to convert
      existing CVS repositories into Subversion ones.</para>

    <para>The most popular (and mature) conversion tool is
      cvs2svn (<ulink url="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/"/>), a Python
      program originally created by members of Subversion's own
      development community.  This tool is meant to run exactly once:
      it scans your CVS repository multiple times and attempts to
      deduce commits, branches, and tags as best it can.  When it
      finishes, the result is either a Subversion repository or a
      portable Subversion dump file representing your code's history.
      See the web site for detailed instructions and caveats.</para>

  <title>WebDAV and Autoversioning</title>

  <para>WebDAV is an extension to HTTP, and it is growing more and more
    popular as a standard for file sharing.  Today's operating systems
    are becoming extremely web-aware, and many now have built-in
    support for mounting <quote>shares</quote> exported by WebDAV
    servers.</para>

  <para>If you use Apache as your Subversion network server, to
    some extent you are also running a WebDAV server.  This appendix
    gives some background on the nature of this protocol, how
    Subversion uses it, and how well Subversion interoperates with
    other software that is WebDAV-aware.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.webdav.basic">
    <title>What Is WebDAV?</title>

    <para><firstterm>DAV</firstterm> stands for <quote>Distributed
      Authoring and Versioning.</quote>  RFC 2518 defines a set of
      concepts and accompanying extension methods to HTTP 1.1 that
      make the Web a more universal read/write medium.  The basic
      idea is that a WebDAV-compliant web server can act like a
      generic file server; clients can <quote>mount</quote> shared
      folders over HTTP that behave much like other network
      filesystems (such as NFS or SMB).</para>

    <para>The tragedy, though, is that despite the acronym, the RFC
      specification doesn't actually describe any sort of version
      control.  Basic WebDAV clients and servers assume that only one
      version of each file or directory exists, and that it can be
      repeatedly overwritten.</para>

    <para>Because RFC 2518 left out versioning concepts, another
      committee was left with the responsibility of writing RFC 3253 a
      few years later.  The new RFC adds versioning concepts to
      WebDAV, placing the <quote>V</quote> back in
      <quote>DAV</quote>&#x2014;hence the term <quote>DeltaV.</quote>
      WebDAV/DeltaV clients and servers are often called just
      <quote>DeltaV</quote> programs, since DeltaV implies the
      existence of basic WebDAV.</para>

    <para>The original WebDAV standard has been widely successful.
      Every modern computer operating system has a general WebDAV
      client built in (details to follow), and a number of popular
      standalone applications are also able to speak
      WebDAV&#x2014;Microsoft Office, Dreamweaver, and Photoshop, to
      name a few.  On the server end, Apache HTTP Server has been
      able to provide WebDAV services since 1998 and is considered the
      de facto open source standard.  Several other
      commercial WebDAV servers are available, including Microsoft's own
      IIS.</para>

    <para>DeltaV, unfortunately, has not been so successful.  It's
      very difficult to find any DeltaV clients or servers.  The few
      that do exist are relatively unknown commercial products, and
      thus it's very difficult to test interoperability.  It's not
      entirely clear as to why DeltaV has remained stagnant.  Some
      opine that the specification is just too complex.  Others argue
      that while WebDAV's features have mass appeal (even the least
      technical users appreciate network file sharing), its version
      control features just aren't interesting or necessary for most
      users.  Finally, some believe that DeltaV remains unpopular
      because there's still no open source server product that
      implements it well.</para>

    <para>When Subversion was still in its design phase, it seemed
      like a great idea to use Apache as a network server.  It already
      had a module to provide WebDAV services.  DeltaV was a
      relatively new specification.  The hope was that the Subversion
      server module (<command>mod_dav_svn</command>) would eventually
      evolve into an open source DeltaV reference implementation.
      Unfortunately, DeltaV has a very specific versioning model that
      doesn't quite line up with Subversion's model.  Some concepts
      were mappable; others were not.</para>

    <para>What does this mean, then?</para>

    <para>First, the Subversion client is not a fully implemented
      DeltaV client.  It needs certain types of things from the server
      that DeltaV itself cannot provide, and thus is largely dependent
      on a number of Subversion-specific
      HTTP <literal>REPORT</literal> requests that
      only <command>mod_dav_svn</command> understands.</para>

    <para>Second, <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is not a
      fully realized DeltaV server.  Many portions of the DeltaV
      specification were irrelevant to Subversion, and thus were left
      unimplemented.</para>

    <para>There is still some debate in the developer community as to
      whether or not it's worthwhile to remedy either of these
      situations.  It's fairly unrealistic to change Subversion's
      design to match DeltaV, so there's probably no way the client
      can ever learn to get everything it needs from a general DeltaV
      server.  On the other hand,
      <command>mod_dav_svn</command> <emphasis>could</emphasis> be
      further developed to implement all of DeltaV, but it's hard to
      find motivation to do so&#x2014;there are almost no DeltaV
      clients to interoperate with.</para>

  <sect1 id="svn.webdav.autoversioning">
    <title>Autoversioning</title>

    <para>While the Subversion client is not a full DeltaV client, and
      the Subversion server is not a full DeltaV server, there's still a
      glimmer of WebDAV interoperability to be happy about:
      <firstterm>autoversioning</firstterm>.</para>

    <para>Autoversioning is an optional feature defined in the DeltaV
      standard.  A typical DeltaV server will reject an ignorant
      WebDAV client attempting to do a <literal>PUT</literal> to a
      file that's under version control.  To change a
      version-controlled file, the server expects a series of proper
      versioning requests: something like
      <literal>MKACTIVITY</literal>, <literal>CHECKOUT</literal>,
      <literal>PUT</literal>, <literal>CHECKIN</literal>.  But if the
      DeltaV server supports autoversioning, write requests from
      basic WebDAV clients are accepted.  The server behaves as though the
      client <emphasis>had</emphasis> issued the proper series of
      versioning requests, performing a commit under the hood.  In
      other words, it allows a DeltaV server to interoperate with
      ordinary WebDAV clients that don't understand versioning.</para>

    <para>Because so many operating systems already have integrated
      WebDAV clients, the use case for this feature can be incredibly
      appealing to administrators working with non-technical users.
      Imagine an office of ordinary users running Microsoft Windows or
      Mac OS.  Each user <quote>mounts</quote> the Subversion
      repository, which appears to be an ordinary network folder.
      They use the shared folder as they always do:  open files, edit
      them, and save them.  Meanwhile, the server is automatically
      versioning everything.  Any administrator (or knowledgeable
      user) can still use a Subversion client to search history and
      retrieve older versions of data.</para>

    <para>This scenario isn't fiction&#x2014;it's real and it works, as
      of Subversion 1.2 and later.  To activate autoversioning in
      <command>mod_dav_svn</command>, use the
      <literal>SVNAutoversioning</literal> directive within the
      <filename>httpd.conf</filename> <literal>Location</literal>
      block, like so:</para>

    <screen>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on
&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

    <para>When Subversion autoversioning is active, write requests
      from WebDAV clients result in automatic commits.  A generic log
      message is automatically generated and attached to each
      revision.</para>

    <para>Before activating this feature, however, understand what
      you're getting into.  WebDAV clients tend to do
      <emphasis>many</emphasis> write requests, resulting in a huge
      number of automatically committed revisions.  For example, when
      saving data, many clients will do a <literal>PUT</literal> of a
      0-byte file (as a way of reserving a name) followed by another
      <literal>PUT</literal> with the real file data.  The single
      file-write results in two separate commits.  Also consider that
      many applications auto-save every few minutes, resulting in even
      more commits.</para>

    <para>If you have a post-commit hook program that sends email, you
      may want to disable email generation either altogether or on
      certain sections of the repository; it depends on whether you
      think the influx of emails will still prove to be valuable
      notifications or not.  Also, a smart post-commit hook program
      can distinguish between a transaction created via autoversioning
      and one created through a normal Subversion commit operation.
      The trick is to look for a revision property
      named <literal>svn:autoversioned</literal>.  If present, the
      commit was made by a generic WebDAV client.</para>

    <para>Another feature that may be a useful complement for
      Subversion's autoversioning comes from Apache's
      <literal>mod_mime</literal> module.  If a WebDAV client adds a
      new file to the repository, there's no opportunity for the user
      to set the the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property.  This
      might cause the file to appear as a generic icon when viewed
      within a WebDAV shared folder, not having an association with
      any application.  One remedy is to have a sysadmin (or other
      Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a working copy and
      manually set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on
      necessary files. But there's potentially no end to such cleanup
      tasks.  Instead, you can use the
      <literal>ModMimeUsePathInfo</literal> directive in your
      Subversion <literal>&lt;Location&gt;</literal> block:</para>

    <screen>
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on

  ModMimeUsePathInfo on

&lt;/Location&gt;
</screen>

    <para>This directive allows <literal>mod_mime</literal> to attempt
      automatic deduction of the MIME type on new files that enter the
      repository via autoversioning.  The module looks at the file's
      named extension and possibly the contents as well; if the file
      matches some common patterns, the
      file's <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property will be set
      automatically.</para>

        <para>DAV Explorer is another standalone WebDAV client, written
          in Java.  It's under a free Apache-like license and is
          available at <ulink url="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/"/>.
          It does everything cadaver does, but has the
          advantages of being portable and being a more user-friendly GUI
          application.  It's also one of the first clients to support
          the new WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744).</para>

        <para>Of course, DAV Explorer's ACL support is useless in this
          case, since <command>mod_dav_svn</command> doesn't support
          it.  The fact that both cadaver and DAV Explorer support
          some limited DeltaV commands isn't particularly useful
          either, since they don't allow <literal>MKACTIVITY</literal>
          requests.  But it's not relevant anyway; we're assuming all
          of these clients are operating against an autoversioning
          repository.</para>

      <title>File-Explorer WebDAV Extensions</title>

      <para>Some popular file explorer GUI programs support WebDAV
        extensions that allow a user to browse a DAV share as though it
        was just another directory on the local computer, and to
        perform basic tree editing operations on the items in that
        share.  For example, Windows Explorer is able to browse a
        WebDAV server as a <quote>network place.</quote>  Users can
        drag files to and from the desktop, or can rename, copy, or
        delete files in the usual way.  But because it's only a
        feature of the file explorer, the DAV share isn't visible to
        ordinary applications.  All DAV interaction must happen
        through the explorer interface.</para>

      <sect3 id="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions.windows">
        <title>Microsoft Web Folders</title>

        <para>Microsoft was one of the original backers of the WebDAV
          specification, and first started shipping a client in
          Windows 98, which was known as Web Folders.  This client was
          also shipped in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.</para>

        <para>The original Web Folders client was an extension to
          Explorer, the main GUI program used to browse filesystems.  It
          works well enough.  In Windows 98, the feature might need to
          be explicitly installed if Web Folders aren't already visible
          inside My Computer.  In Windows 2000, simply
          add a new <quote>network place,</quote> enter the URL, and the
          WebDAV share will pop up for browsing.</para>

        <para>With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft started shipping
          a new implementation of Web Folders, known as the WebDAV
          Mini-Redirector.  The new implementation is a
          filesystem-level client, allowing WebDAV shares to be mounted
          as drive letters.  Unfortunately, this implementation is
          incredibly buggy.  The client usually tries to convert HTTP
          URLs (<literal>http://host/repos</literal>) into UNC share
          notation (<literal>\\host\repos</literal>); it also often
          tries to use Windows Domain authentication to respond to
          basic-auth HTTP challenges, sending usernames as
          <literal>HOST\username</literal>.  These interoperability
          problems are severe and are documented in numerous places around
          the Web, to the frustration of many users.  Even Greg Stein,
          the original author of Apache's WebDAV module, bluntly
          states that XP Web Folders simply can't operate against an Apache
          server.</para>

        <para>Windows Vista's initial implementation of Web Folders seems to
          be almost the same as XP's, so it has the same sort of
          problems.  With luck, Microsoft will remedy these issues in
          a Vista Service Pack.</para>

        <para>However, there seem to be workarounds for both XP and
          Vista that allow Web Folders to work against Apache.  Users
          have mostly reported success with these techniques, so we'll
          relay them here.</para>

        <para>On Windows XP, you have two options.  First, search
          Microsoft's web site for update KB90730, <quote>Software
          Update for Web Folders.</quote>  This may fix all your
          problems.  If it doesn't, it seems that the original pre-XP
          Web Folders implementation is still buried within the
          system.  You can unearth it by going to Network
          Places and adding a new network place.  When prompted,
          enter the URL of the repository, but <emphasis>include a
          port number</emphasis> in the URL.  For
          example, you should enter <userinput>http://host/repos</userinput> 
          as <userinput>http://host:80/repos</userinput> instead.
          Respond to any authentication prompts with your Subversion
          credentials.</para>

        <para>On Windows Vista, the same KB90730 update may clear
          everything up.  But there may still be other issues.  Some
          users have reported that Vista considers
          all <literal>http://</literal> connections insecure, and thus
          will always fail any authentication challenges from Apache
          unless the connection happens
          over <literal>https://</literal>.  If you're unable to connect
          to the Subversion repository via SSL, you can tweak the
          system registry to turn off this behavior.  Just change the
          value of the <literal>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel</literal>
          key from <userinput>1</userinput> to <userinput>2</userinput>.  A final warning:  be sure to set up the Web
          Folder to point to the repository's root directory
          (<filename>/</filename>), rather than some subdirectory
          such as <filename>/trunk</filename>.  Vista Web Folders
          seems to work only against repository roots.</para>

        <para>In general, while these workarounds may function for
          you, you might get a better overall experience using a
          third-party WebDAV client such as WebDrive or NetDrive.</para>

        <para>Nautilus is the official file manager/browser for the
          GNOME desktop (<ulink url="http://www.gnome.org"/>), and
          Konqueror is the manager/browser for the KDE desktop (<ulink url="http://www.kde.org"/>).  Both of these applications
          have an explorer-level WebDAV client built in, and they
          operate just fine against an autoversioning repository.</para>

        <para>In GNOME's Nautilus, select the <guimenuitem>File&#x2192;Open
          location</guimenuitem> menu item and enter the URL in the
          dialog box presented.  The repository should then be
          displayed like any other filesystem.</para>

        <para>In KDE's Konqueror, you need to use the
          <literal>webdav://</literal> scheme when entering the URL in
          the location bar.  If you enter
          an <literal>http://</literal> URL, Konqueror will behave
          like an ordinary web browser.  You'll likely see the generic
          HTML directory listing produced
          by <command>mod_dav_svn</command>.  When you enter
          <userinput>webdav://host/repos</userinput> instead of
          <userinput>http://host/repos</userinput>, Konqueror becomes a
          WebDAV client and displays the repository as a

      <title>WebDAV Filesystem Implementation</title>

      <para>The WebDAV filesystem implementation is arguably the best
        sort of WebDAV client.  It's implemented as a low-level
        filesystem module, typically within the operating system's
        kernel.  This means that the DAV share is mounted like any
        other network filesystem, similar to mounting an NFS share on
        Unix or attaching an SMB share as a drive letter in Windows.
        As a result, this sort of client provides completely
        transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs.
        Applications aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are
        happening.</para>

        <para>Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial
          products that allow a WebDAV share to be attached as drive
          letters in Windows.  As a result, you can operate on the
          contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudodrives as easily as
          you can against real local hard drives, and in the same
          ways.  You can purchase WebDrive from South River
          Technologies (<ulink url="http://www.southrivertech.com"/>).
          Novell's NetDrive is freely available online, but requires
          users to have a NetWare license.</para>

        <para>Apple's OS X operating system has an integrated
          filesystem-level WebDAV client.  From the Finder, select the
          <guimenuitem>Go&#x2192;Connect to Server</guimenuitem> menu
          item.  Enter a WebDAV URL, and it appears as a disk on the
          desktop, just like any other mounted volume.  You can also
          mount a WebDAV share from the Darwin terminal by using the
          <literal>webdav</literal> filesystem type with the
          <command>mount</command> command:</para>

        <screen>
$ mount -t webdav http://svn.example.com/repos/project /some/mountpoint
$
</screen>

        <para>Note that if your <command>mod_dav_svn</command> is
          older than version 1.2, OS X will refuse to mount the share
          as read/write; it will appear as read-only.  This is because
          OS X insists on locking support for read/write shares, and
          the ability to lock files first appeared in Subversion
          1.2.</para>

        <para>Also, OS X's WebDAV client can sometimes be overly
          sensitive to HTTP redirects.  If OS X is unable to mount the
          repository at all, you may need to enable the <literal>BrowserMatch</literal>
          directive in the Apache server's

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
      unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
      assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
      defined below) for the purposes of this License.

   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
      musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
      picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving
      image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
      purpose of this License.

   c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work
      under the terms of this License.

   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under
      the terms of this License.

   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this
      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this
      License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
   under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
   below:

   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in
      the Collective Works;

   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
      audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in
      Collective Works;

   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital
      audio transmission Derivative Works.

   e.

      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether
            individually or via a performance rights society
            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
            performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
            of the Work.

        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
            via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry
            Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from
            the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the
            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US
            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for
      the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,
      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
      of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of
      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any
      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this
      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in
      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License
      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work
      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the
      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,
      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to
      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or
      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for
      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the
      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or
      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the
      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such
      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,
      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
      (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
      "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective
      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other
      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative
      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,
      will not have their licenses terminated provided such
      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
      termination of this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work
      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
      license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
