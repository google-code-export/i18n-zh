Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, organized effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions must be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective experience of users in the wild.

Officially, their task was to write a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an initial draft. But they also had access to a steady stream—indeed, an uncontrollable geyser—of bottom-up source material. Subversion was already in the hands of thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of feedback, not only about Subversion, but about its existing documentation."

msgid "During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and Brian haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms incessantly, carefully noting the problems users were having in real-life situations. Monitoring such feedback was part of their job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge advantage when they set out to document Subversion. The book they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience, not in the shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet. This duality might not be noticeable on a first reading. Taken in order, front to back, the book is simply a straightforward description of a piece of software. There's the overview, the obligatory guided tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced topics, and of course a command reference and troubleshooting guide. Only when you come back to it later, seeking the solution to some specific problem, does its authenticity shine out: the telling details that can only result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the user's point of view."

CVS was open source software itself, and its nonrestrictive modus operandi and support for networked operation allowed dozens of geographically dispersed programmers to share their work.

While the result isn't necessarily the next great evolution in version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very powerful, very usable, and very flexible.

CollabNet offers a collaboration software suite called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE), of which one component is version control. Although CEE used CVS as its initial version control system, CVS's limitations were obvious from the beginning, and CollabNet knew it would eventually have to find something better. Unfortunately, CVS had become the de facto standard in the open source world largely because there <emphasis>wasn't</emphasis> anything better, at least not under a free license.

Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already discussing a design for a new version control system with his friend Jim Blandy. In 1995, the two had started Cyclic Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and although they later sold the business, they still used CVS every day at their jobs. Their frustration with CVS had led Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned data, and he'd already come up with not only the name <quote>Subversion,</quote> but also with the basic design of the Subversion data store. When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period of time. CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and detailed design work began in May 2000. With the help of some well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of CollabNet, and from Greg Stein (at the time an independent developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process), Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers. It turned out that many people had encountered the same frustrating experiences with CVS and welcomed the chance to finally do something about it."

Many other version control systems use per-file revision numbers, so this concept may seem unusual at first. (Former CVS users might want to see <xref linkend=\"svn.forcvs\"/> for more details.)"

Any number of changes might have happened in the repository between revisions 10 and 15. The client knows nothing of those changes in the repository, since you haven't yet run <command>svn update</command>, and <command>svn commit</command> doesn't pull down new changes. If, on the other hand, <command>svn commit</command> were to automatically download the newest changes, then it would be possible to set the entire working copy to revision 15—but then we'd be breaking the fundamental rule of <quote>push</quote> and <quote>pull</quote> remaining separate actions.

Once again, these mappings affect adds and imports, and can not only override the default MIME type decision made by Subversion during those operations, but can also set additional Subversion or custom properties, too. For example, you might create a mapping that says that any time you add JPEG files—ones whose names match the pattern <literal>*.jpg</literal>—Subversion should automatically set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on those files to <literal>image/jpeg</literal>.

Harry and Sally are both graphic designers working on the same project, a bit of marketing collateral for an automobile mechanic. Central to the design of a particular poster is an image of a car in need of some body work, stored in a file using the PNG image format. The poster's layout is almost finished, and both Harry and Sally are pleased with the particular photo they chose for their damaged car—a baby blue 1967 Ford Mustang with an unfortunate bit of crumpling on the left front fender."

Meanwhile, Harry, feeling particularly inspired that day, decides that the image would have greater impact if the car also appears to have suffered greater impact. He, too, updates to <literal>HEAD</literal>, and then draws some cracks on the vehicle's windshield. He manages to finish his work before Sally finishes hers, and after admiring the fruits of his undeniable talent, commits the modified image. Shortly thereafter, Sally is finished with the car's new finish and tries to commit her changes. But, as expected, Subversion fails the commit, informing Sally that her version of the image is now out of date."

In Gmail, you apply arbitrary labels to emails, and multiple emails can be said to be part of the same group if they happen to share a particular label. Viewing only a group of similarly labeled emails then becomes a simple user interface trick. Many other Web 2.0 sites have similar mechanisms—consider the <quote>tags</quote> used by sites such as <link href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</link> and <link href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</link>, <quote>categories</quote> applied to blog posts, and so on.

Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server process that mediates all access to tables. If a program accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess left behind. And because the database daemon is the only process accessing the tables, applications don't need to worry about permission conflicts. These things are not the case with Berkeley DB, however. Subversion (and programs using Subversion libraries) access the database tables directly, which means that a program crash can leave the database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state. When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance. Other things can cause a repository to <quote>wedge</quote> besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over ownership and permissions on the database files."

Even though this scenario still uses <command>svnserve</command>, it differs quite a bit in features from a traditional <command>svnserve</command> deployment. SSH is used to encrypt all communication. SSH is also used exclusively to authenticate, so real system accounts are required on the server host (unlike vanilla <command>svnserve</command>, which has its own private user accounts.) Finally, because this setup requires that each user spawn a private, temporary <command>svnserve</command> process, it's equivalent (from a permissions point of view) to allowing a group of local users to all access the repository via <literal>file://</literal> URLs. Path-based access control has no meaning, since each user is accessing the repository database files directly."

By default, those conflict files have names constructed by appending to the original filename a custom extension such as <filename>.mine</filename> or <filename>.<replaceable>REV</replaceable></filename> (where <replaceable>REV</replaceable> is a revision number). A mild annoyance with this naming scheme is that on operating systems where a file's extension determines the default application used to open and edit that file, appending a custom extension prevents the file from being easily opened by its native application. For example, if the file <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf</filename> was conflicted, the conflict files might be named <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf.mine</filename> or <filename>ReleaseNotes.pdf.r4231</filename>. While your system might be configured to use Adobe's Acrobat Reader to open files whose extensions are <filename>.pdf</filename>, there probably isn't an application configured on your system to open all files whose extensions are <filename>.r4231</filename>."

To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters, most of which were quite specific to the utilities. Some time later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library, and as a failover mechanism, the <option>--diff-cmd</option> and <option>--diff3-cmd</option> options were added to the Subversion command-line client so users could more easily indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3 utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.

APR is Apache's portability library, originally carved out of its server code as an attempt to separate the OS-specific bits from the OS-independent portions of the code. The result was a library that provides a generic API for performing operations that differ mildly—or wildly—from OS to OS. While the Apache HTTP Server was obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion developers immediately recognized the value of using APR as well. This means that there is practically no OS-specific code in Subversion itself. Also, it means that the Subversion client compiles and runs anywhere that Apache HTTP Server does. Currently this list includes all flavors of Unix, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X."

This is an extremely difficult problem to solve; it involves deducing changesets in the absence of atomicity and translating between the systems' completely orthogonal branching policies, among other complications.

msgid "The WebDAV filesystem implementation is arguably the best sort of WebDAV client. It's implemented as a low-level filesystem module, typically within the operating system's kernel. This means that the DAV share is mounted like any other network filesystem, similar to mounting an NFS share on Unix or attaching an SMB share as drive letter in Windows. As a result, this sort of client provides completely transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs. Applications aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are happening."

msgid "Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial products that allow a WebDAV share to be attached as drive letters in Windows. As a result, you can operate on the contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudo-drives as easily as you can against real local hard drives, and in the same ways. WebDrive can be purchased from South River Technologies (<uri href=\"http://www.southrivertech.com\">http://www.southrivertech.com</uri>). Novell's NetDrive is freely available online, but requires users to have a Netware license."

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\nREGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR\nDAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\n\nLicense\n\nTHE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS\nCREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS\nPROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE\nWORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS\nPROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND\nAGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS\nYOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF\nSUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n   a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue,\n      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in\n      unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,\n      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are\n      assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a\n      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as\n      defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n\n   b. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the\n      Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,\n      musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion\n      picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,\n      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,\n      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a\n      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the\n      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the\n      Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the\n      synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving\n      image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the\n      purpose of this License.\n\n   c. \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work\n      under the terms of this License.\n\n   d. \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n\n   e. \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under\n      the terms of this License.\n\n   f. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n      License who has not previously violated the terms of this\n      License with respect to the Work, or who has received express\n      permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this\n      License despite a previous violation.\n\n2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,\n   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or\n   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner\n   under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\n   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n   non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable\n   copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated\n   below:\n\n   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in\n      the Collective Works;\n\n   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n\n   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,\n      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital\n      audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in\n      Collective Works;\n\n   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,\n      perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital\n      audio transmission Derivative Works.\n\n   e.\n\n      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n\n         i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor\n            waives the exclusive right to collect, whether\n            individually or via a performance rights society\n            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public\n            performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)\n            of the Work.\n\n        ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives\n            the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or\n            via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry\n            Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from\n            the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the\n            compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US\n            Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n\n   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of\n      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the\n      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\n      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for\n      the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work,\n      subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114\n      of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other\n      jurisdictions).\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\nin other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by\nLicensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\n   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n      publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this\n      License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n      Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of\n      the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any\n      terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this\n      License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted\n      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\n      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly\n      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any\n      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in\n      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\n      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\n      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\n      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\n      upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n      practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to\n      such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n\n   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or\n      publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or\n      Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for\n      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the\n      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\n      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the\n      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably\n      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\n      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,\n      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work\n      (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n      \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\n      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\n      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\nLICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\nWARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\nSTATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF\nTITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\nNONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,\nOR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nDISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\n   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n   DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\n      Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however,\n      will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\n      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n      termination of this License.\n\n   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted\n      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright\n      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the\n      right to release the Work under different license terms or to\n      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that\n      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or\n      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue\n      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work\n      or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\n      license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n      license granted to You under this License.\n\n   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a\n      Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n      the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n      license granted to You under this License.\n\n   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\n      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\n      to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\n      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver\n      or consent.\n\n   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\n      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\n      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n      agreement of the Licensor and You.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\nwhatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\nliable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\nwhatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\nincidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\nlicense.
