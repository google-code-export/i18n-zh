It is particularly well-suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software, though it is by no means limited to them. Because it is a large and robust format, and because its main structures correspond to the general notion of what constitutes a book, DocBook has been adopted by a large and constantly growing community of authors. DocBook is supported <quote>out of the box</quote> by a wide range of tools, both open source and commercial. In short, DocBook is an easy-to-understand and widely used schema.
