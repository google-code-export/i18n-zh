Release Notes

The Release Notes contain important information for new users and for
an update from the previous version of Debian. It is written in
DocBook XML which allows the creation of various output files in the
formats HTML, text, PDF, ...

To build it you need these packages:
 - docbook-xsl         (transformation stylesheets)
 - libxml2-utils       (for xmllint)
 - dblatex and xmlroff (depending on the output format and language)
 - po4a                (for handling PO file based translations)
 - make                (or you will type a lot)
 - ttf-arphic-*        (fonts)
 - texlive-*           (used by dblatex)
 - w3m                 (to create the text version)

For etch, you need the lenny backports of dblatex and xmlroff.

Just call "make" to build it. To build the release notes in a single
format (html or txt or pdf) for a single language (e.g. zh_CN, en, es)
and the "all" pseudo-architecture, call e.g.:
"make html LINGUA=es architecture=all".

Translations

The document is available in many languages. po4a is currently used as
the translation tool.

To add a new language "new", do as follows:

$ svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals/trunk/release-notes
$ cd release-notes
$ mkdir new
$ make updatepo LINGUA=new
(now translate all po files in new/)
(if your new language is supported by dblatex, add a file
hyphenation.tex to the language directory, e.g.
$ cp en/hyphenation.tex; svn add new/hyphenation.tex
edit the file to your new languages needs.
See the LaTeX \hyphenation{} command for further information.)
$ make tidypo LINGUA=new (always before commit!)
$ make validate LINGUA=new (always before commit!)
(fix any XML validity problems)
$ make html txt pdf LINGUA=new architecture=all
(proof-read and correct)
$ svn commit

Some translators prefer full-text translation without po. For this
style of translations, the original English files are just copied
into the language directory and the translators have to make sure,
that the translation is up to date.

Send your translation for inclusion to the public mailing list
debian-doc@lists.debian.org.
