      made out of a number of different checkouts.  For example, you
      may want different subdirectories to come from different
      locations in a repository or perhaps from different
      repositories altogether.  You could certainly set up such a
      scenario by hand&#8212;using <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> to
      create the sort of nested working copy structure you are trying
      to achieve.  But if this layout is important for everyone who
      uses your repository, every other user will need to perform the
      same checkout operations that you did.</p><p>Fortunately, Subversion provides support for
      <em class="firstterm">externals definitions</em>.  An externals
      definition is a mapping of a local directory to the
      URL&#8212;and ideally a particular revision&#8212;of a versioned
      directory.  In Subversion, you declare externals definitions in
      groups using the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property.  You
      can create or modify this property using <span class="command"><strong>svn
      propset</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.manip" title="&#25805;&#20316;&#23646;&#24615;">&#8220;&#25805;&#20316;&#23646;&#24615;&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>).  It can be set on any
      versioned directory, and its value describes both the external
      repository location and the client-side directory to which that
      location should be checked out.</p><p>The convenience of the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code>
      property is that once it is set on a versioned directory,
      everyone who checks out a working copy with that directory also
      gets the benefit of the externals definition.  In other words,
      once one person has made the effort to define the nested working
      copy structure, no one else has to bother&#8212;Subversion will,
      after checking out the original working copy, automatically also
      check out the external working copies.</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#35686;&#21578;</h3><p>&#22806;&#37096;&#23450;&#20041;&#30340;&#30456;&#23545;&#30446;&#26631;&#23376;&#30446;&#24405;&#19981;&#38656;&#35201;&#23384;&#22312;&#20110;&#20320;&#30340;&#25110;&#20854;&#23427;&#29992;&#25143;&#30340;&#31995;&#32479;&#20013;&#8212;Subversion&#20250;&#22312;&#26816;&#20986;&#24037;&#20316;&#25335;&#36125;&#26102;&#21019;&#24314;&#36825;&#20123;&#25991;&#20214;&#12290;&#23454;&#38469;&#19978;&#65292;&#20320;&#19968;&#23450;&#19981;&#35201;&#20351;&#29992;&#22806;&#37096;&#23450;&#20041;&#26469;&#20135;&#29983;&#24050;&#32463;&#22312;&#29256;&#26412;&#25511;&#21046;&#30340;&#36335;&#24452;&#12290;</p></div><p>You also get in the externals definition design all the
      regular benefits of Subversion properties.  The definitions are
      versioned.  If you need to change an externals definition, you
      can do so using the regular property modification subcommands.
      When you commit a change to the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code>
      property, Subversion will synchronize the checked-out items
      against the changed externals definition when you next run
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>.  The same thing will happen when
      others update their working copies and receive your changes to
      the externals definition.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#25552;&#31034;</h3><p>&#22240;&#20026;<code class="literal">svn:externals</code>&#30340;&#20540;&#26159;&#22810;&#34892;&#30340;&#65292;&#25152;&#20197;&#25105;&#20204;&#24378;&#28872;&#24314;&#35758;&#20351;&#29992;<span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span>&#65292;&#32780;&#19981;&#26159;&#20351;&#29992;<span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>&#12290;</p></div><p>Subversion releases prior to 1.5 honor an externals
      definition format that is a multiline table of subdirectories
      (relative to the versioned directory on which the property is
      set), optional revision flags, and fully qualified, absolute
      Subversion repository URLs.  An example of this might looks as
      follows:</p><pre class="screen">

third-party/skins/toolkit -r21 http://svn.example.com/skin-maker
</pre><p>When someone checks out a working copy of the
      <code class="filename">calc</code> directory referred to in the previous
      example, Subversion also continues to check out the items found
      in its externals definition.</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>As of Subversion 1.5, though, a new format of the
      <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is supported.
      Externals definitions are still multiline, but the order and
      format of the various pieces of information has changed.  The
      new syntax more closely mimics the order of arguments you might
      pass to <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>: the optional revision
      flags come first, then the external Subversion repository URL,
      and finally the relative local subdirectory.  Notice, though,
      that this time we didn't say &#8220;<span class="quote">fully qualified, absolute
      Subversion repository URLs.</span>&#8221; That's because the new
      format supports relative URLs and URLs that carry peg revisions.
      The previous example of an externals definition might, in
      Subversion 1.5, look like the following:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
      http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
-r148 http://svn.example.com/skinproj third-party/skins
-r21  http://svn.example.com/skin-maker third-party/skins/toolkit
</pre><p>Or, making use of the peg revision syntax (which we describe
      in detail in <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.pegrevs.html" title="Peg&#21644;&#23454;&#26045;&#20462;&#35746;&#29256;&#26412;">&#8220;Peg&#21644;&#23454;&#26045;&#20462;&#35746;&#29256;&#26412;&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>), it might
      appear as:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
http://svn.example.com/repos/sounds third-party/sounds
http://svn.example.com/skinproj@148 third-party/skins

</pre><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#25552;&#31034;</h3><p>You should seriously consider using explicit revision
        numbers in all of your externals definitions.  Doing so means
        that you get to decide when to pull down a different snapshot
        of external information, and exactly which snapshot to pull.
        Besides avoiding the surprise of getting changes to
        third-party repositories that you might not have any control
        over, using explicit revision numbers also means that as you
        backdate your working copy to a previous revision, your
        externals definitions will also revert to the way they looked
        in that previous revision, which in turn means that the
        external working copies will be updated to match the way
        <span class="emphasis"><em>they</em></span> looked back when your repository was
        at that previous revision.  For software projects, this could
        be the difference between a successful and a failed build of
        an older snapshot of your complex codebase.</p></div><p>For most repositories, these three ways of formatting the
      external definitions have the same ultimate effect.  They all
      bring the same benefits.  Unfortunately, they all bring the same
      annoyances, too.  Since the definitions shown use absolute URLs,
      moving or copying a directory to which they are attached will
      not affect what gets checked out as an external (though the
      relative local target subdirectory will, of course, move with
      renamed directory).  This can be confusing&#8212;even
      frustrating&#8212;in certain situations.  For example, say you
      have a top-level directory named
      <code class="filename">my-project</code>, and you've created an externals
      definition on one of its subdirectories
      (<code class="filename">my-project/some-dir</code>) that tracks the
      latest revision of another of its subdirectories
      (<code class="filename">my-project/external-dir</code>).</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>Also, absolute URLs can cause problems with repositories
      that are available via multiple URL schemes.  For example, if
      your Subversion server is configured to allow everyone to check
      out the repository over <code class="literal">http://</code> or
      <code class="literal">https://</code>, but only allow commits to come in
      via <code class="literal">https://</code>, you have an interesting problem
      on your hands.  If your externals definitions use the
      <code class="literal">http://</code> form of the repository URLs, you
      won't be able to commit anything from the working copies created
      by those externals.  On the other hand, if they use the
      <code class="literal">https://</code> form of the URLs, anyone who might
      be checking out via <code class="literal">http://</code> because their
      client doesn't support <code class="literal">https://</code> will be
      unable to fetch the external items.  Be aware, too, that if you
      need to re-parent your working copy (using <span class="command"><strong>svn switch
      --relocate</strong></span>), externals definitions will
      <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> also be re-parented.</p><p>Subversion 1.5 takes a huge step in relieving these
     frustrations.  As mentioned earlier, the URLs used in the new
     externals definition format can be relative, and Subversion
     provides syntax magic for specifying multiple flavors of URL
     relativity.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">../</span></dt><dd><p>Relative to the URL of the directory on which
          the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is
          set.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">^/</span></dt><dd><p>Relative to the root of the repository in
          which the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is
          versioned.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">//</span></dt><dd><p>Relative to the scheme of the URL of the
          directory on which the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code>
          property is set.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">/</span></dt><dd><p>Relative to the root URL of the server on
          which the <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property is
          versioned.</p></dd></dl></div><p>So, looking a fourth time at our previous externals
      definition example, and making use of the new absolute URL
      syntax in various ways, we might now see:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn propget svn:externals calc
^/sounds third-party/sounds
/skinproj@148 third-party/skins
//svn.example.com/skin-maker@21 third-party/skins/toolkit
</pre><p>The support that exists for externals definitions in
      Subversion remains less than ideal, though.  An externals
      definition can only point to directories, not files.  Also, the
      local subdirectory part of the definition cannot contain
      <code class="literal">..</code> parent directory indicators (such as
      <code class="filename">../../skins/myskin</code>).  Perhap most
      disappointinly, the working copies created via the externals
      definition support are still disconnected from the primary
      working copy (on whose versioned directories the
      <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> property was actually set).
      And Subversion still only truly operates on nondisjoint working
      copies.  So, for example, if you want to commit changes that
      you've made in one or more of those external working copies, you
      must run <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> explicitly on those
      working copies&#8212;committing on the primary working copy will
      not recurse into any external ones.</p><p>We've already mentioned some of the additional shortcomings
      of the old <code class="literal">svn:externals</code> format and how the
      new Subversion 1.5 format improves upon it.  But be careful when
      making use of the new format that you don't inadvertantly cause
      problems for other folks accessing your repository who are using
      older Subversion clients.  While Subversion 1.5 clients will
      continue to recognize and support the original externals
      definition format, older clients will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
      be able to correctly parse the new format.</p><p>Besides the <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
      update</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>, and
      <span class="command"><strong>svn export</strong></span> commands which actually manage the
      <em class="firstterm">disjoint</em> (or disconnected) subdirectories
      into which externals are checked out, the <span class="command"><strong>svn
      status</strong></span> command also recognizes externals definitions.
      It displays a status code of <code class="literal">X</code> for the
      disjoint external subdirectories, and then recurses into those
      subdirectories to display the status of the external items
      themselves.  You can pass the
      <code class="option">--ignore-externals</code> option to any of these
      subcommands to disable externals definition processing.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="svn.advanced.locking.html">&#19978;&#19968;&#39029;</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="svn.advanced.html">&#19978;&#19968;&#32423;</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="svn.advanced.pegrevs.html">&#19979;&#19968;&#39029;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">&#38145;&#23450;&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">&#36215;&#22987;&#39029;</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Peg&#21644;&#23454;&#26045;&#20462;&#35746;&#29256;&#26412;</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
