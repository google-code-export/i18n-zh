      a recursive manner.  For example, <span class="command"><strong>svn
      checkout</strong></span> creates a working copy with every file and
      directory in the specified area of the repository, descending
      recursively through the repository tree until the entire
      structure is copied to your local disk.  Subversion 1.5
      introduces a feature called <em class="firstterm">sparse
      directories</em> (or <em class="firstterm">shallow
      checkouts</em>) which allows you to easily checkout a
      working copy&#8212;or a portion of a working copy&#8212;more
      shallowly than full recursion, with the freedom to bring in
      previously ignored files and subdirectories at a later
      time.</p><p>For example, say we have a repository with a tree of files
      and directories named like the members of a human family with
      pets.  (It's an odd example, to be sure, but bear with us.)  A
      regular <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> operation will give us a
      working copy of the whole tree:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom
A    mom/son
A    mom/son/grandson
A    mom/daughter

</pre><p>Now, let's checkout the same tree again, but this time,
      we'll ask Subversion to give us only the topmost direcectory
      with none of its children at all.</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-empty --depth empty
Checked out revision 1
$
</pre><p>Notice that we added to our original <span class="command"><strong>svn
      checkout</strong></span> command line a new <code class="option">--depth</code>
      option.  This option is present on many of Subversion's
      subcommands, and is similar to the <code class="option">--non-recursive
      (-N)</code> and <code class="option">--recursive (-R)</code> options.  In
      fact, it combines, improves upon, supercedes, and ultimately
      obsoletes these two older options.  For starters, it expands the
      supported degrees of depth specification available to users,
      adding some previously unsupported (or inconsistently supported)
      depths.  Here are the depth values that you can request for a
      given Subversion operation:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">
            <code class="literal">--depth empty</code>
          </span></dt><dd><p>Include only the immediate target of the operation,
            not any of its file or directory children.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
            <code class="literal">--depth files</code>
          </span></dt><dd><p>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file chidren.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
            <code class="literal">--depth immediates</code>
          </span></dt><dd><p>Include the immediate target of the operation and any
            of its immediate file or directory chidren.  The directory
            children will themselves be empty.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">
            <code class="literal">--depth infinity</code>
          </span></dt><dd><p>Include the immediate target, its file and directory
            children, its children's children, and so on to full
            recursion.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Of course, merely combining two existing options into one
      hardly constitutes a new feature worthy of a whole section in
      our book.  Fortunately, there is more to this story.  This idea
      of depth extends not just to the operations you perform with
      your Subversion client, but also as a description of a working
      copy citizen's <em class="firstterm">ambient depth</em>&#8212;the
      depth persistently recorded by the working copy for that item.
      Its key strength is this very persistence, the fact that it is
      &#8220;<span class="quote">sticky</span>&#8221;.  The working copy remembers the depth
      you've selected for each item in it until you later change that
      depth selection, and by default, Subversion commands operate on
      the working copy citizens present, regardless of their selected
      depth settings.</p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">&#25552;&#31034;</h3><p>You can check the recorded ambient depth of a working copy
        using the <span class="command"><strong>svn info</strong></span> command.  If the ambient
        depth is anything other than infinite recursion, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        info</strong></span> will display a line describing that depth
        value:</p><pre class="screen">$ svn info mom-immediates | grep '^Depth:'
Depth: immediates
$
</pre></div><p>Our previous examples demonstrated checkouts of infinite
      depth (the default for <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>) and
      empty depth.  Let's look now at examples of the other depth
      values:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos mom-files --depth files

Checked out revision 1.
$
</pre><p>As described, each of these depths is something more than
      only-the-target, but something less than full recursion.</p><p>We've used <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span> as an example
      here, but you'll find the <code class="option">--depth</code> option
      present on many other Subversion commands, too.  In those other
      commands, depth specification is a way to limit the scope of an
      operation to some depth, much like the way the older
      <code class="option">--non-recursive (-N)</code> and <code class="option">--recursive
      (-R)</code> options behave.  This means that when operating on
      a working copy of some depth, and requesting an operation of a
      shallower depth, the operation is limited to that shallower
      depth.  In fact, we can make an even more general statement:
      given a working copy of any arbitrary&#8212;even
      mixed&#8212;ambient depth, and a Subversion command with some
      requested operational depth, the command will maintain the
      ambient depth of the working copy members while still limiting
      the scope of the operation to the requested (or default)
      operational depth.</p><p>In addition to the <code class="option">--depth</code> option, the
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>
      subcommands also accept a second depth-related option:
      <code class="option">--set-depth</code>.  It is with this option that you
      can change the sticky depth of a working copy item.  Watch what
      happens as we take our empty-depth checkout and gradually
      telescope it deeper using <span class="command"><strong>svn update
      --set-depth</strong></span>:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>As we gradually increased our depth selection, the
      repository gave us more pieces of our tree.</p><p>In our example, we operated only on the root of our working
      copy, changing its ambient depth value.  But we can
      independently change the ambient depth value of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> subdirectory inside the working copy,
      too.  Careful use of this ability allows us to flesh out only
      certain portions of the working copy tree, leaving other
      portions absent altogether (hence the &#8220;<span class="quote">sparse</span>&#8221; bit
      of the feature's name).  Here's an example of how we might build
      out a portion of one branch of our family's tree, enable full
      recursion on another branch, and still other pieces pruned
      (absent from disk).</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>Fortunately, having a complex collection of ambient depths
      in a single working copy doesn't complicate the way you interact
      with that working copy.  You can still make, revert, display and
      commit local modifications in your working copy without
      providing any new options (including <code class="option">--depth</code> or
      <code class="option">--set-depth</code>) to the relevant subcommands.  Even
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> works as it does elsewhere when no
      specific depth is provided&#8212;it updates the working copy
      targets that are present while honoring their sticky
      depths.</p><p>You might at this point be wondering, &#8220;<span class="quote">So what?  When
      would I use this?</span>&#8221;.  One scenario where this feature
      finds utility is tied to a particular repository layout,
      specifically where you have many related or co-dependent
      projects or software modules living as siblings in a single
      repository location (<code class="filename">trunk/project1</code>,
      <code class="filename">trunk/project2</code>,
      <code class="filename">trunk/project3</code>, and so on).  In such
      scenarios, it might be the case that you personally only care
      about a handful of those projects&#8212;maybe some primary
      project and a few other modules on which it depends.  You can
      checkout individual working copies of all of these things, but
      those working copies are disjoint and, as a result, it can be
      cumbersome to perform operations across several or all of them
      at the same time.  The alternative is to use the sparse
      directories feature, building out a single working copy that
      contains only the modules you care about.  You'd start with an
      empty-depth checkout of the common parent directory of the
      projects, and then update with infinite depth only the items you
      wish to have, like we demonstrated in the previous example.
      Think of it like an opt-in system for working copy
      citizens.</p><p>Subversion 1.5's implementation of shallow checkouts is
      good, but does not support a couple of interesting behaviors.
      First, you cannot de-telescope a working copy item.  Running
      <span class="command"><strong>svn update --set-depth empty</strong></span> on an
      infinite-depth working copy will not have the effect of
      discarding everything but the top-most directory&#8212;it will
      simply error out.  Secondly, there is no depth value to indicate
      that you wish an item to be explicitly excluded.  You have to do
      implicit exclusion of an item by including everything
      else.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s05.html">&#19978;&#19968;&#39029;</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">&#19978;&#19968;&#32423;</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s07.html">&#19979;&#19968;&#39029;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">&#20851;&#38190;&#23383;&#26367;&#25442;&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">&#36215;&#22987;&#39029;</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;&#38145;&#23450;</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
