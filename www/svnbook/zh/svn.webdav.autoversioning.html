<p>While the Subversion client is not a full DeltaV client, and the Subversion
server is not a full DeltaV server, there's still a glimmer of WebDAV
interoperability to be happy about: <em class="firstterm">autoversioning</em>.</p>
<p>Autoversioning is an optional feature defined in the DeltaV standard.  A
typical DeltaV server will reject an ignorant WebDAV client attempting to do
a <code class="literal">PUT</code> to a file that's under version control.  To change
a version-controlled file, the server expects a series of proper versioning
requests: something like <code class="literal">MKACTIVITY</code>,
<code class="literal">CHECKOUT</code>, <code class="literal">PUT</code>,
<code class="literal">CHECKIN</code>.  But if the DeltaV server supports
autoversioning, write requests from basic WebDAV clients are accepted.  The
server behaves as though the client <span class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> issued the
proper series of versioning requests, performing a commit under the hood.
In other words, it allows a DeltaV server to interoperate with ordinary
WebDAV clients that don't understand versioning.</p>
<p>Because so many operating systems already have integrated WebDAV clients,
the use case for this feature can be incredibly appealing to administrators
working with non-technical users.  Imagine an office of ordinary users
running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.  Each user “<span class="quote">mounts</span>” the
Subversion repository, which appears to be an ordinary network folder.  They
use the shared folder as they always do: open files, edit them, and save
them.  Meanwhile, the server is automatically versioning everything.  Any
administrator (or knowledgeable user) can still use a Subversion client to
search history and retrieve older versions of data.</p>
<p>This scenario isn't fiction—it's real and it works, as of Subversion
1.2 and later.  To activate autoversioning in
<span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>, use the <code class="literal">SVNAutoversioning</code>
directive within the <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>
<code class="literal">Location</code> block, like so:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
<p>When Subversion autoversioning is active, write requests from WebDAV clients
result in automatic commits.  A generic log message is automatically
generated and attached to each revision.</p>
<p>Before activating this feature, however, understand what you're getting
into.  WebDAV clients tend to do <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> write requests,
resulting in a huge number of automatically committed revisions.  For
example, when saving data, many clients will do a <code class="literal">PUT</code> of
a 0-byte file (as a way of reserving a name) followed by another
<code class="literal">PUT</code> with the real file data.  The single file-write
results in two separate commits.  Also consider that many applications
auto-save every few minutes, resulting in even more commits.</p>
<p>If you have a post-commit hook program that sends email, you may want to
disable email generation either altogether or on certain sections of the
repository; it depends on whether you think the influx of emails will still
prove to be valuable notifications or not.  Also, a smart post-commit hook
program can distinguish between a transaction created via autoversioning and
one created through a normal Subversion commit operation.  The trick is to
look for a revision property named <code class="literal">svn:autoversioned</code>.  If
present, the commit was made by a generic WebDAV client.</p>
<p>Another feature that may be a useful complement for Subversion's
autoversioning comes from Apache's <code class="literal">mod_mime</code> module.  If a
WebDAV client adds a new file to the repository, there's no opportunity for
the user to set the the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.  This
might cause the file to appear as a generic icon when viewed within a WebDAV
shared folder, not having an association with any application.  One remedy
is to have a sysadmin (or other Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a
working copy and manually set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property
on necessary files. But there's potentially no end to such cleanup tasks.
Instead, you can use the <code class="literal">ModMimeUsePathInfo</code> directive in
your Subversion <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block:</p>
<pre class="screen">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on

  ModMimeUsePathInfo on

&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
<p>This directive allows <code class="literal">mod_mime</code> to attempt automatic
deduction of the MIME type on new files that enter the repository via
autoversioning.  The module looks at the file's named extension and possibly
the contents as well; if the file matches some common patterns, the file's
<code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property will be set automatically.</p>
