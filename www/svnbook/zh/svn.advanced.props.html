<a class="indexterm" name="id355820"></a><p>We've already covered in detail how Subversion stores and retrieves various
versions of files and directories in its repository.  Whole chapters have
been devoted to this most fundamental piece of functionality provided by the
tool.  And if the versioning support stopped there, Subversion would still
be complete from a version control perspective.</p>
<p>但不仅仅如此。</p>
<p>In addition to versioning your directories and files, Subversion provides
interfaces for adding, modifying, and removing versioned metadata on each of
your versioned directories and files.  We refer to this metadata as
<em class="firstterm">properties</em>, and they can be thought of as two-column
tables that map property names to arbitrary values attached to each item in
your working copy.  Generally speaking, the names and values of the
properties can be whatever you want them to be, with the constraint that the
names must contain only ASCII characters.  And the best part about these
properties is that they, too, are versioned, just like the textual contents
of your files.  You can modify, commit, and revert property changes as
easily as you can file content changes.  And the sending and receiving of
property changes occurs as part of your typical commit and update
operations—you don't have to change your basic processes to
accommodate them.</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>Subversion has reserved the set of properties whose names begin with
<code class="literal">svn:</code> as its own.  While there are only a handful of such
properties in use today, you should avoid creating custom properties for
your own needs whose names begin with this prefix.  Otherwise, you run the
risk that a future release of Subversion will grow support for a feature or
behavior driven by a property of the same name but with perhaps an entirely
different interpretation.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too.  Just as files and
directories may have arbitrary property names and values attached to them,
each revision as a whole may have arbitrary properties attached to it.  The
same constraints apply—human-readable names and anything-you-want
binary values.  The main difference is that revision properties are not
versioned.  In other words, if you change the value of, or delete, a
revision property, there's no way, within the scope of Subversion's
functionality, to recover the previous value.</p>
<p>Subversion has no particular policy regarding the use of properties.  It
asks only that you not use property names that begin with the prefix
<code class="literal">svn:</code>.  That's the namespace that it sets aside for its
own use.  And Subversion does, in fact, use properties—both the
versioned and unversioned variety.  Certain versioned properties have
special meaning or effects when found on files and directories, or they
house a particular bit of information about the revisions on which they are
found.  Certain revision properties are automatically attached to revisions
by Subversion's commit process, and they carry information about the
revision.  Most of these properties are mentioned elsewhere in this or other
chapters as part of the more general topics to which they are related.  For
an exhaustive list of Subversion's predefined properties, see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.properties.html" title="9.10. Subversion 属性">第 9.10 节 “Subversion 属性”</a>.</p>
<p>In this section, we will examine the utility—both to users of
Subversion and to Subversion itself—of property support.  You'll learn
about the property-related <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands and how
property modifications affect your normal Subversion workflow.</p>

<p>Just as Subversion uses properties to store extra information about the
files, directories, and revisions that it contains, you might also find
properties to be of similar use.  You might find it useful to have a place
close to your versioned data to hang custom metadata about that data.</p>
<p>Say you wish to design a web site that houses many digital photos and
displays them with captions and a datestamp.  Now, your set of photos is
constantly changing, so you'd like to have as much of this site automated as
possible.  These photos can be quite large, so as is common with sites of
this nature, you want to provide smaller thumbnail images to your site
visitors.</p>
<p>Now, you can get this functionality using traditional files.  That is, you
can have your <code class="filename">image123.jpg</code> and an
<code class="filename">image123-thumbnail.jpg</code> side by side in a directory.  Or
if you want to keep the filenames the same, you might have your thumbnails
in a different directory, such as
<code class="filename">thumbnails/image123.jpg</code>.  You can also store your
captions and datestamps in a similar fashion, again separated from the
original image file.  But the problem here is that your collection of files
multiplies with each new photo added to the site.</p>
<p>Now consider the same web site deployed in a way that makes use of
Subversion's file properties.  Imagine having a single image file,
<code class="filename">image123.jpg</code>, with properties set on that file that are
named <code class="literal">caption</code>, <code class="literal">datestamp</code>, and even
<code class="literal">thumbnail</code>.  Now your working copy directory looks much
more manageable—in fact, it looks to the casual browser like there are
nothing but image files in it.  But your automation scripts know better.
They know that they can use <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> (or better yet, they can
use the Subversion language bindings—see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.usingapi.html" title="8.3. 使用 API">第 8.3 节 “使用 API”</a>) to dig out the extra information that
your site needs to display without having to read an index file or play path
manipulation games.</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>While Subversion places few restrictions on the names and values you use for
properties, it has not been designed to optimally carry large property
values or large sets of properties on a given file or directory.  Subversion
commonly holds all the property names and values associated with a single
item in memory at the same time, which can cause detrimental performance or
failed operations when extremely large property sets are used.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Custom revision properties are also frequently used.  One common such use is
a property whose value contains an issue tracker ID with which the revision
is associated, perhaps because the change made in that revision fixes a bug
filed in the tracker issue with that ID.  Other uses include hanging more
friendly names on the revision—it might be hard to remember that
revision 1935 was a fully tested revision.  But if there's, say, a
<code class="literal">test-results</code> property on that revision with the value
<code class="literal">all passing</code>, that's meaningful information to have.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>可搜索性(或者，为什么<span class="emphasis"><em>不</em></span>使用属性)</b></p>
<p>For all their utility, Subversion properties—or, more accurately, the
available interfaces to them—have a major shortcoming: while it is a
simple matter to <span class="emphasis"><em>set</em></span> a custom property,
<span class="emphasis"><em>finding</em></span> that property later is a whole different ball
of wax.</p>
<p>Trying to locate a custom revision property generally involves performing a
linear walk across all the revisions of the repository, asking of each
revision, "Do you have the property I'm looking for?" Trying to find a
custom versioned property is painful, too, and often involves a recursive
<span class="command"><strong>svn propget</strong></span> across an entire working copy.  In your
situation, that might not be as bad as a linear walk across all revisions.
But it certainly leaves much to be desired in terms of both performance and
likelihood of success, especially if the scope of your search would require
a working copy from the root of your repository.</p>
<p>For this reason, you might choose—especially in the revision property
use case—to simply add your metadata to the revision's log message
using some policy-driven (and perhaps programmatically enforced)  formatting
that is designed to be quickly parsed from the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
log</strong></span>.  It is quite common to see the following in Subversion log
messages:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">

</pre>
<p>But here again lies some misfortune.  Subversion doesn't yet provide a log
message templating mechanism, which would go a long way toward helping users
be consistent with the formatting of their log-embedded revision metadata.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">

<p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program affords a few ways to add or modify file
and directory properties.  For properties with short, human-readable values,
perhaps the simplest way to add a new property is to specify the property
name and value on the command line of the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>
subcommand:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/button.c
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre>
<p>But we've been touting the flexibility that Subversion offers for your
property values.  And if you are planning to have a multiline textual, or
even binary, property value, you probably do not want to supply that value
on the command line.  So the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> subcommand takes
a <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) option for specifying the
name of a file that contains the new property value.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset license -F /path/to/LICENSE calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre>
<p>There are some restrictions on the names you can use for properties.  A
property name must start with a letter, a colon (<code class="literal">:</code>), or
an underscore (<code class="literal">_</code>); after that, you can also use digits,
hyphens (<code class="literal">-</code>), and periods (<code class="literal">.</code>).
<sup>[<a name="id356156" href="#ftn.id356156" class="footnote">8</a>]</sup>
      </p>
<p>In addition to the <span class="command"><strong>propset</strong></span> command, the
<span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program supplies the <span class="command"><strong>propedit</strong></span>
command.  This command uses the configured editor program (see <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="7.1.3.2. 配置">第 7.1.3.2 节 “配置”</a>) to add or modify
properties.  When you run the command, <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> invokes your
editor program on a temporary file that contains the current value of the
property (or that is empty, if you are adding a new property).  Then, you
just modify that value in your editor program until it represents the new
value you wish to store for the property, save the temporary file, and then
exit the editor program.  If Subversion detects that you've actually changed
the existing value of the property, it will accept that as the new property
value.  If you exit your editor without making any changes, no property
modification will occur:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propedit copyright calc/button.c  ### exit the editor without changes
No changes to property 'copyright' on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre>
<p>We should note that, as with other <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands, those
related to properties can act on multiple paths at once.  This enables you
to modify properties on whole sets of files with a single command.  For
example, we could have done the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/*
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/Makefile'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/integer.c'
…
$
</pre>
<p>All of this property adding and editing isn't really very useful if you
can't easily get the stored property value.  So the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
program supplies two subcommands for displaying the names and values of
properties stored on files and directories.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn
proplist</strong></span> command will list the names of properties that exist on a
path.  Once you know the names of the properties on the node, you can
request their values individually using <span class="command"><strong>svn propget</strong></span>.
This command will, given a property name and a path (or set of paths), print
the value of the property to the standard output stream.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn proplist calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright
  license
$ svn propget copyright calc/button.c
(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software
</pre>
<p>There's even a variation of the <span class="command"><strong>proplist</strong></span> command that
will list both the name and the value for all of the properties.  Simply
supply the <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c

<p>The last property-related subcommand is <span class="command"><strong>propdel</strong></span>.  Since
Subversion allows you to store properties with empty values, you can't
remove a property altogether using <span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>.  For example, this command will
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> yield the desired effect:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset license '' calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software
  license : 
$
</pre>
<p>You need to use the <span class="command"><strong>propdel</strong></span> subcommand to delete
properties altogether.  The syntax is similar to the other property
commands:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propdel license calc/button.c
property 'license' deleted from 'calc/button.c'.
$ svn proplist -v calc/button.c
Properties on 'calc/button.c':
  copyright : (c) 2006 Red-Bean Software
$
</pre>
<p>Remember those unversioned revision properties? You can modify those, too,
using the same <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands that we just described.
Simply add the <code class="option">--revprop</code> command-line parameter and specify
the revision whose property you wish to modify.  Since revisions are global,
you don't need to specify a target path to these property-related commands
so long as you are positioned in a working copy of the repository whose
revision property you wish to modify.  Otherwise, you can simply provide the
URL of any path in the repository of interest (including the repository's
root URL).  For example, you might want to replace the commit log message of
an existing revision.  <sup>[<a name="id356341" href="#ftn.id356341" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup> If your current
working directory is part of a working copy of your repository, you can
simply run the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> command with no target path:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</pre>
<p>But even if you haven't checked out a working copy from that repository, you
can still effect the property change by providing the repository's root URL:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:log '* button.c: Fix a compiler warning.' -r11 --revprop \
              http://svn.example.com/repos/project
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</pre>
<p>Note that the ability to modify these unversioned properties must be
explicitly added by the repository administrator (see <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.setlog" title="5.4.2. 修正提交消息">第 5.4.2 节 “修正提交消息”</a>).  That's because the properties
aren't versioned, so you run the risk of losing information if you aren't
careful with your edits.  The repository administrator can set up methods to
protect against this loss, and by default, modification of unversioned
properties is disabled.</p>

<p>Now that you are familiar with all of the property-related
<span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands, let's see how property modifications
affect the usual Subversion workflow.  As we mentioned earlier, file and
directory properties are versioned, just like your file contents.  As a
result, Subversion provides the same opportunities for merging—cleanly
or with conflicts—someone else's modifications into your own.</p>
<p>As with file contents, your property changes are local modifications, made
permanent only when you commit them to the repository with <span class="command"><strong>svn
commit</strong></span>.  Your property changes can be easily unmade, too—the
<span class="command"><strong>svn revert</strong></span> command will restore your files and
directories to their unedited states—contents, properties, and all.
Also, you can receive interesting information about the state of your file
and directory properties by using the <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> commands.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn status calc/button.c

<p>Notice how the <span class="command"><strong>status</strong></span> subcommand displays
<code class="literal">M</code> in the second column instead of the first.  That is
because we have modified the properties on
<code class="filename">calc/button.c</code>, but not its textual contents.  Had we
changed both, we would have seen <code class="literal">M</code> in the first column,
too.  (We cover <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> in <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.examine.status" title="2.4.3.1. 查看你的修改概况">第 2.4.3.1 节 “查看你的修改概况”</a>).</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>属性冲突</b></p>
<p>As with file contents, local property modifications can conflict with
changes committed by someone else.  If you update your working copy
directory and receive property changes on a versioned object that clash with
your own, Subversion will report that the object is in a conflicted state.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn update calc
M  calc/Makefile.in

$ 
</pre>
<p>Subversion will also create, in the same directory as the conflicted object,
a file with a <code class="filename">.prej</code> extension that contains the details
of the conflict.  You should examine the contents of this file so you can
decide how to resolve the conflict.  Until the conflict is resolved, you
will see a <code class="literal">C</code> in the second column of <span class="command"><strong>svn
status</strong></span> output for that object, and attempts to commit your local
modifications will fail.</p>
<pre class="screen">

</div>
<p>You might also have noticed the nonstandard way that Subversion currently
displays property differences.  You can still use <span class="command"><strong>svn
diff</strong></span> and redirect its output to create a usable patch file.  The
<span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span> program will ignore property patches—as a
rule, it ignores any noise it can't understand.  This does, unfortunately,
mean that to fully apply a patch generated by <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>,
any property modifications will need to be applied by hand.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">

<p>Properties are a powerful feature of Subversion, acting as key components of
many Subversion features discussed elsewhere in this and other
chapters—textual diff and merge support, keyword substitution, newline
translation, and so on.  But to get the full benefit of properties, they
must be set on the right files and directories.  Unfortunately, that step
can be easily forgotten in the routine of things, especially since failing
to set a property doesn't usually result in an obvious error (at least
compared to, say, failing to add a file to version control).  To help your
properties get applied to the places that need them, Subversion provides a
couple of simple but useful features.</p>
<p>Whenever you introduce a file to version control using the <span class="command"><strong>svn
add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> commands, Subversion tries to
assist by setting some common file properties automatically.  First, on
operating systems whose filesystems support an execute permission bit,
Subversion will automatically set the <code class="literal">svn:executable</code>
property on newly added or imported files whose execute bit is enabled.
(See <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.executable" title="3.3.2. 文件的可执行性">第 3.3.2 节 “文件的可执行性”</a> later in this
chapter for more about this property.)</p>
<p>Second, Subversion tries to determine the file's MIME type.  If you've
configured a <code class="literal">mime-types-files</code> runtime configuration
parameter, Subversion will try to find a MIME type mapping in that file for
your file's extension.  If it finds such a mapping, it will set your file's
<code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to the MIME type it found.  If no
mapping file is configured, or no mapping for your file's extension could be
found, Subversion runs a very basic heuristic to determine whether the file
contains nontextual content.  If so, it automatically sets the
<code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on that file to
<code class="literal">application/octet-stream</code> (the generic “<span class="quote">this is a
collection of bytes</span>” MIME type).  Of course, if Subversion guesses
incorrectly, or if you wish to set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
property to something more precise—perhaps
<code class="literal">image/png</code> or
<code class="literal">application/x-shockwave-flash</code>—you can always remove
or edit that property.  (For more on Subversion's use of MIME types, see
<a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="3.3.1. 文件内容类型">第 3.3.1 节 “文件内容类型”</a> later in this
chapter.)</p>
<p>Subversion also provides, via its runtime configuration system (see <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea" title="7.1. 运行配置区">第 7.1 节 “运行配置区”</a>), a more flexible automatic property
setting feature that allows you to create mappings of filename patterns to
property names and values.  Once again, these mappings affect adds and
imports, and can not only override the default MIME type decision made by
Subversion during those operations, but can also set additional Subversion
or custom properties, too.  For example, you might create a mapping that
says that anytime you add JPEG files—ones whose names match the
pattern <code class="literal">*.jpg</code>—Subversion should automatically set
the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on those files to
<code class="literal">image/jpeg</code>.  Or perhaps any files that match
<code class="literal">*.cpp</code> should have <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> set to
<code class="literal">native</code>, and <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> set to
<code class="literal">Id</code>.  Automatic property support is perhaps the handiest
property-related tool in the Subversion toolbox.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.customization.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="7.1.3.2. 配置">第 7.1.3.2 节 “配置”</a> for more about configuring
that support.</p>
