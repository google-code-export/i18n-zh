<p>Fortunately for Subversion users who routinely find themselves on different
computers with different operating systems, Subversion's command-line
program behaves almost identically on all those systems.  If you know how to
wield <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> on one platform, you know how to wield it
everywhere.</p>
<p>However, the same is not always true of other general classes of software or
of the actual files you keep in Subversion.  For example, on a Windows
machine, the definition of a “<span class="quote">text file</span>” would be similar to
that used on a Linux box, but with a key difference—the character
sequences used to mark the ends of the lines of those files.  There are
other differences, too.  Unix platforms have (and Subversion supports)
symbolic links; Windows does not.  Unix platforms use filesystem permission
to determine executability; Windows uses filename extensions.</p>
<p>Because Subversion is in no position to unite the whole world in common
definitions and implementations of all of these things, the best it can do
is to try to help make your life simpler when you need to work with your
versioned files and directories on multiple computers and operating
systems.  This section describes some of the ways Subversion does this.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type"></a>3.3.1. 文件内容类型</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Subversion joins the ranks of the many applications that recognize and make
use of Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content types.  Besides
being a general-purpose storage location for a file's content type, the
value of the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> file property determines some
behavioral characteristics of Subversion itself.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>识别文件类型</b></p>
<p>Various programs on most modern operating systems make assumptions about the
type and format of the contents of a file by the file's name, specifically
its file extension.  For example, files whose names end in
<code class="filename">.txt</code> are generally assumed to be human-readable; that
is, able to be understood by simple perusal rather than requiring complex
processing to decipher.  Files whose names end in <code class="filename">.png</code>,
on the other hand, are assumed to be of the Portable Network Graphics
type—not human-readable at all, and sensible only when interpreted by
software that understands the PNG format and can render the information in
that format as a raster image.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of those extensions have changed their meanings over
time.  When personal computers first appeared, a file named
<code class="filename">README.DOC</code> would have almost certainly been a
plain-text file, just like today's <code class="filename">.txt</code> files.  But by
the mid-1990s, you could almost bet that a file of that name would not be a
plain-text file at all, but instead a Microsoft Word document in a
proprietary, non-human-readable format.  But this change didn't occur
overnight—there was certainly a period of confusion for computer users
over what exactly they had in hand when they saw a <code class="filename">.DOC</code>
file.  <sup>[<a name="id356859" href="#ftn.id356859" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup>
        </p>
<p>The popularity of computer networking cast still more doubt on the mapping
between a file's name and its content.  With information being served across
networks and generated dynamically by server-side scripts, there was often
no real file per se, and therefore no filename.  Web servers, for example,
needed some other way to tell browsers what they were downloading so that
the browser could do something intelligent with that information, whether
that was to display the data using a program registered to handle that
datatype or to prompt the user for where on the client machine to store the
downloaded data.</p>
<p>Eventually, a standard emerged for, among other things, describing the
contents of a data stream.  In 1996, RFC 2045 was published.  It was the
first of five RFCs describing MIME.  It describes the concept of media types
and subtypes and recommends a syntax for the representation of those types.
Today, MIME media types—or “<span class="quote">MIME types</span>”—are used
almost universally across email applications, web servers, and other
software as the de facto mechanism for clearing up the file content
confusion.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, one of the benefits that Subversion typically provides is
contextual, line-based merging of changes received from the server during an
update into your working file.  But for files containing nontextual data,
there is often no concept of a “<span class="quote">line.</span>” So, for versioned files
whose <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is set to a nontextual MIME
type (generally, something that doesn't begin with <code class="literal">text/</code>,
though there are exceptions), Subversion does not attempt to perform
contextual merges during updates.  Instead, any time you have locally
modified a binary working copy file that is also being updated, your file is
left untouched and Subversion creates two new files.  One file has a
<code class="filename">.oldrev</code> extension and contains the BASE revision of the
file.  The other file has a <code class="filename">.newrev</code> extension and
contains the contents of the updated revision of the file.  This behavior is
really for the protection of the user against failed attempts at performing
contextual merges on files that simply cannot be contextually merged.</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property, when set to a value that does
not indicate textual file contents, can cause some unexpected behaviors with
respect to other properties.  For example, since the idea of line endings
(and therefore, line-ending conversion) makes no sense when applied to
nontextual files, Subversion will prevent you from setting the
<code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property on such files.  This is obvious
when attempted on a single file target—<span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>
will error out.  But it might not be as clear if you perform a recursive
property set, where Subversion will silently skip over files that it deems
unsuitable for a given property.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>Beginning in Subversion 1.5, users can configure a new
<code class="literal">mime-types-file</code> runtime configuration parameter, which
identifies the location of a MIME types mapping file.  Subversion will
consult this mapping file to determine the MIME type of newly added and
imported files.</p>
<p>Also, if the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property is set, then the
Subversion Apache module will use its value to populate the
<code class="literal">Content-type:</code> HTTP header when responding to GET
requests.  This gives your web browser a crucial clue about how to display a
file when you use it to peruse your Subversion repository's contents.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.props.special.executable"></a>3.3.2. 文件的可执行性</h3></div></div></div>
<p>On many operating systems, the ability to execute a file as a command is
governed by the presence of an execute permission bit.  This bit usually
defaults to being disabled, and must be explicitly enabled by the user for
each file that needs it.  But it would be a monumental hassle to have to
remember exactly which files in a freshly checked-out working copy were
supposed to have their executable bits toggled on, and then to have to do
that toggling.  So, Subversion provides the
<code class="literal">svn:executable</code> property as a way to specify that the
executable bit for the file on which that property is set should be enabled,
and Subversion honors that request when populating working copies with such
files.</p>
<p>This property has no effect on filesystems that have no concept of an
executable permission bit, such as FAT32 and NTFS.  <sup>[<a name="id357011" href="#ftn.id357011" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup> Also, although it has no defined values, Subversion
will force its value to <code class="literal">*</code> when setting this property.
Finally, this property is valid only on files, not on directories.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="zh">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.props.special.eol-style"></a>3.3.3. 行结束字符序列</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Unless otherwise noted using a versioned file's
<code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property, Subversion assumes the file
contains human-readable data.  Generally speaking, Subversion uses this
knowledge only to determine whether contextual difference reports for that
file are possible.  Otherwise, to Subversion, bytes are bytes.</p>
<p>This means that by default, Subversion doesn't pay any attention to the type
of <em class="firstterm">end-of-line (EOL)  markers</em> used in your files.
Unfortunately, different operating systems have different conventions about
which character sequences represent the end of a line of text in a file.
For example, the usual line-ending token used by software on the Windows
platform is a pair of ASCII control characters—a carriage return
(<code class="literal">CR</code>)  followed by a line feed (<code class="literal">LF</code>).
Unix software, however, just uses the <code class="literal">LF</code> character to
denote the end of a line.</p>
<p>Not all of the various tools on these operating systems understand files
that contain line endings in a format that differs from the
<em class="firstterm">native line-ending style</em> of the operating system on
which they are running.  So, typically, Unix programs treat the
<code class="literal">CR</code> character present in Windows files as a regular
character (usually rendered as <code class="literal">^M</code>), and Windows programs
combine all of the lines of a Unix file into one giant line because no
carriage return-linefeed (or <code class="literal">CRLF</code>) character combination
was found to denote the ends of the lines.</p>
<p>This sensitivity to foreign EOL markers can be frustrating for folks who
share a file across different operating systems.  For example, consider a
source code file, and developers that edit this file on both Windows and
Unix systems.  If all the developers always use tools that preserve the
line-ending style of the file, no problems occur.</p>
<p>But in practice, many common tools either fail to properly read a file with
foreign EOL markers, or convert the file's line endings to the native style
when the file is saved.  If the former is true for a developer, he has to
use an external conversion utility (such as <span class="command"><strong>dos2unix</strong></span> or
its companion, <span class="command"><strong>unix2dos</strong></span>) to prepare the file for
editing.  The latter case requires no extra preparation.  But both cases
result in a file that differs from the original quite literally on every
line! Prior to committing his changes, the user has two choices.  Either he
can use a conversion utility to restore the modified file to the same
line-ending style that it was in before his edits were made, or he can
simply commit the file—new EOL markers and all.</p>
<p>The result of scenarios like these include wasted time and unnecessary
modifications to committed files.  Wasted time is painful enough.  But when
commits change every line in a file, this complicates the job of determining
which of those lines were changed in a nontrivial way.  Where was that bug
really fixed? On what line was a syntax error introduced?</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is the <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code>
property.  When this property is set to a valid value, Subversion uses it to
determine what special processing to perform on the file so that the file's
line-ending style isn't flip-flopping with every commit that comes from a
different operating system.  The valid values are:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">native</code></span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This causes the file to contain the EOL markers that are native to the
operating system on which Subversion was run.  In other words, if a user on
a Windows machine checks out a working copy that contains a file with an
<code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> property set to <code class="literal">native</code>,
that file will contain <code class="literal">CRLF</code> EOL markers.  A Unix user
checking out a working copy that contains the same file will see
<code class="literal">LF</code> EOL markers in his copy of the file.</p>
<p>Note that Subversion will actually store the file in the repository using
normalized <code class="literal">LF</code> EOL markers regardless of the operating
system.  This is basically transparent to the user, though.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">CRLF</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>这会导致这个文件使用<code class="literal">CRLF</code>序列作为EOL标志，不管使用何种操作系统。</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">LF</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>这会导致文件使用<code class="literal">LF</code>字符作为EOL标志，不管使用何种操作系统。</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">CR</code></span></dt>
<dd><p>This causes the file to contain <code class="literal">CR</code> characters for EOL
markers, regardless of the operating system in use.  This line-ending style
is not very common.</p></dd>
