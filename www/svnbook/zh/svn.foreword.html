<p>A bad Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) sheet is one that is composed not of
the questions people actually ask, but of the questions the FAQ's author
<span class="emphasis"><em>wishes</em></span> people would ask.  Perhaps you've seen the type
before:</p>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Q：怎样使用 Glorbosoft XYZ 最大程度的提高团队生产率？</p></blockquote></div>
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A: Many of our customers want to know how they can maximize productivity
through our patented office groupware innovations.  The answer is simple.
First, click on the <code class="literal">File</code> menu, scroll down to
<code class="literal">Increase Productivity</code>, then…</p></blockquote></div>
<p>The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a literal sense, FAQs at
all.  No one ever called the tech support line and asked, “<span class="quote">How can we
maximize productivity?</span>” Rather, people asked highly specific
questions, such as “<span class="quote">How can we change the calendaring system to send
reminders two days in advance instead of one?</span>” and so on.  But it's a
lot easier to make up imaginary Frequently Asked Questions than it is to
discover the real ones.  Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained,
organized effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions must
be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a coherent,
searchable whole that reflects the collective experience of users in the
wild.  It calls for the patient, observant attitude of a field naturalist.
No grand hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here—open eyes
and accurate note-taking are what's needed most.</p>
<p>What I love about this book is that it grew out of just such a process, and
shows it on every page.  It is the direct result of the authors' encounters
with users.  It began with Ben Collins-Sussman's observation that people
were asking the same basic questions over and over on the Subversion mailing
lists: what are the standard workflows to use with Subversion? Do branches
and tags work the same way as in other version control systems? How can I
find out who made a particular change?</p>
<p>Frustrated at seeing the same questions day after day, Ben worked intensely
over a month in the summer of 2002 to write <em class="citetitle">The Subversion
Handbook</em>, a 60-page manual that covered all the basics of using
Subversion.  The manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was
distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump in the
learning curve.  When O'Reilly decided to publish a full-length Subversion
book, the path of least resistance was obvious: just expand the Subversion
handbook.</p>
<p>The three coauthors of the new book were thus presented with an unusual
opportunity.  Officially, their task was to write a book top-down, starting
from a table of contents and an initial draft.  But they also had access to
a steady stream—indeed, an uncontrollable geyser—of bottom-up
source material.  Subversion was already in the hands of thousands of early
adopters, and those users were giving tons of feedback, not only about
Subversion, but also about its existing documentation.</p>
<p>During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and Brian haunted
the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms incessantly, carefully noting
the problems users were having in real-life situations.  Monitoring such
feedback was part of their job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave
them a huge advantage when they set out to document Subversion.  The book
they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience, not in the
shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the best aspects of user
manual and FAQ sheet.  This duality might not be noticeable on a first
reading.  Taken in order, front to back, the book is simply a
straightforward description of a piece of software.  There's the overview,
the obligatory guided tour, the chapter on administrative configuration,
some advanced topics, and of course, a command reference and troubleshooting
guide.  Only when you come back to it later, seeking the solution to some
specific problem, does its authenticity shine out: the telling details that
can only result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples honed from
genuine use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and
the user's point of view.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can promise that this book will answer every question you
have about Subversion.  Sometimes the precision with which it anticipates
your questions will seem eerily telepathic; yet occasionally, you will
stumble into a hole in the community's knowledge and come away
empty-handed.  When this happens, the best thing you can do is email
<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:users@subversion.tigris.org">users@subversion.tigris.org</a>&gt;</code> and present your problem.  The
authors are still there and still watching, and the authors include not just
the three listed on the cover, but many others who contributed corrections
and original material.  From the community's point of view, solving your
problem is merely a pleasant side effect of a much larger
project—namely, slowly adjusting this book, and ultimately Subversion
itself, to more closely match the way people actually use it.  They are
eager to hear from you, not only because they can help you, but because you
can help them.  With Subversion, as with all active free software projects,
<span class="emphasis"><em>you are not alone</em></span>.</p>
