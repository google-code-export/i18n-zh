<p>It's time to move from the abstract to the concrete.  In
      this section, we'll show real examples of Subversion being
      used.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.advanced.reposurls"></a>1.3.1. Subversion Repository URLs</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Throughout this book, Subversion uses URLs to identify
        versioned files and directories in Subversion repositories.
        For the most part, these URLs use the standard syntax,
        allowing for server names and port numbers to be specified as
        part of the URL:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com:9834/repos
…
</pre>
<p>But there are some nuances in Subversion's handling of URLs
        that are notable.  For example, URLs containing the
        <code class="literal">file://</code> access method (used for local
        repositories) must, in accordance with convention, have either a
        server name of <code class="literal">localhost</code> or no server name at
        all:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout file:///var/svn/repos
…
$ svn checkout file://localhost/var/svn/repos
…
</pre>
<p>Also, users of the <code class="literal">file://</code> scheme on
        Windows platforms will need to use an unofficially
        “<span class="quote">standard</span>” syntax for accessing repositories
        that are on the same machine, but on a different drive than
        the client's current working drive.  Either of the two
        following URL path syntaxes will work, where
        <code class="literal">X</code> is the drive on which the repository
        resides:</p>
<pre class="screen">
C:\&gt; svn checkout file:///X:/var/svn/repos
…
C:\&gt; svn checkout "file:///X|/var/svn/repos"
…
</pre>
<p>In the second syntax, you need to quote the URL so that the
        vertical bar character is not interpreted as a pipe.  Also, note
        that a URL uses forward slashes even though the native
        (non-URL) form of a path on Windows uses backslashes.</p>

<th align="left">Note</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>You cannot use Subversion's <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs
          in a regular web browser the way typical
          <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs can.  When you attempt to view
          a <code class="literal">file://</code> URL in a regular web browser, it
          reads and displays the contents of the file at that location
          by examining the filesystem directly.  However, Subversion's
          resources exist in a virtual filesystem (see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.html#svn.developer.layerlib.repos" title="8.1.1. Repository Layer">Section 8.1.1, “Repository Layer”</a>), and your browser
          will not understand how to interact with that
          filesystem.</p></td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>The Subversion client will automatically encode URLs as
        necessary, just like a web browser does.  For example, if a
        URL contains a space or upper-ASCII character as in the
        following:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout "http://host/path with space/project/españa"
</pre>
<p>then Subversion will escape the unsafe characters
        and behave as though you had typed:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://host/path%20with%20space/project/espa%C3%B1a
</pre>
<p>If the URL contains spaces, be sure to place it within quotation
        marks so that your shell treats the whole thing as a single
        argument to the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program.</p>
<p>In Subversion 1.6, a new caret (<code class="literal">^</code>)
        notation was introduced as a shorthand for “<span class="quote">the URL of
        the repository's root directory</span>”.  For example:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn list ^/tags/bigsandwich/
</pre>
<p>In this example, we're specifying a URL for
        the <code class="filename">/tags/bigsandwich</code> directory in the
        root of the repository.  Note that this URL
        syntax <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> works when your current
        working directory is a working copy—the commandline
        client knows the repository's root URL by looking at the
        working copy's metadata.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.wc.sb-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Repository URLs</b></p>
<p>You can access Subversion repositories through many
          different methods—on local disk or through various
          network protocols, depending on how your administrator has
          set things up for you.  A repository location, however, is
          always a URL.

<a name="svn.basic.in-action.wc"></a>1.3.2. Working Copies</h3></div></div></div>
<p>You've already read about working copies; now we'll
        demonstrate how the Subversion client creates and uses
        them.</p>
<p>A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on
        your local system, containing a collection of files.  You can
        edit these files however you wish, and if they're source code
        files, you can compile your program from them in the usual
        way.  Your working copy is your own private work area:
        Subversion will never incorporate other people's changes, nor
        make your own changes available to others, until you
        explicitly tell it to do so.  You can even have multiple
        working copies of the same project.</p>
<p>After you've made some changes to the files in your
        working copy and verified that they work properly, Subversion
        provides you with commands to “<span class="quote">publish</span>” your
        changes to the other people working with you on your project
        (by writing to the repository).  If other people publish their
        own changes, Subversion provides you with commands to merge
        those changes into your working copy (by reading from the
        repository).</p>
<p>A working copy also contains some extra files, created and
        maintained by Subversion, to help it carry out these commands.
        In particular, each directory in your working copy contains a
        subdirectory named <code class="filename">.svn</code>, also known as
        the working copy's <em class="firstterm">administrative
        directory</em>.  The files in each administrative
        directory help Subversion recognize which files contain
        unpublished changes, and which files are out of date with
        respect to others' work.</p>
<p>A typical Subversion repository often holds the files (or
        source code) for several projects; usually, each project is a
        subdirectory in the repository's filesystem tree.  In this
        arrangement, a user's working copy will usually correspond to
        a particular subtree of the repository.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a repository that contains
        two software projects, <code class="literal">paint</code> and
        <code class="literal">calc</code>.  Each project lives in its own
        top-level subdirectory, as shown in <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1" title="Figure 1.6. The repository's filesystem">Figure 1.6, “The repository's filesystem”</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.6. The repository's filesystem</b></p>
<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch02dia6.png" alt="The repository's filesystem"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>To get a working copy, you must <em class="firstterm">check
        out</em> some subtree of the repository.  (The term
        <span class="emphasis"><em>check out</em></span> may sound like it has something to do
        with locking or reserving resources, but it doesn't; it simply
        creates a private copy of the project for you.) For example,
        if you check out <code class="filename">/calc</code>, you will get a
        working copy like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
A    calc/Makefile
A    calc/integer.c
A    calc/button.c
Checked out revision 56.

$ ls -A calc
Makefile  button.c integer.c .svn/
</pre>
<p>The list of letter <code class="literal">A</code>s in the left
        margin indicates that Subversion is adding a number of items
        to your working copy.  You now have a personal copy of the
        repository's <code class="filename">/calc</code> directory, with one
        additional entry—<code class="filename">.svn</code>—which
        holds the extra information needed by Subversion, as mentioned
        earlier.</p>
<p>Suppose you make changes to <code class="filename">button.c</code>.
        Since the <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory remembers the
        file's original modification date and contents, Subversion can
        tell that you've changed the file.  However, Subversion does
        not make your changes public until you explicitly tell it to.
        The act of publishing your changes is more commonly known as
        <em class="firstterm">committing</em> (or <em class="firstterm">checking
        in</em>) changes to the repository.</p>
<p>To publish your changes to others, you can use
        Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command:</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ svn commit button.c -m "Fixed a typo in button.c."
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 57.
</pre>
<p>Now your changes to <code class="filename">button.c</code> have
        been committed to the repository, with a note describing your
        change (namely, that you fixed a typo).  If another user
        checks out a working copy of <code class="filename">/calc</code>, she
        will see your changes in the latest version of the
        file.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a collaborator, Sally, who checked out a
        working copy of <code class="filename">/calc</code> at the same time
        you did.  When you commit your change to
        <code class="filename">button.c</code>, Sally's working copy is left
        unchanged; Subversion modifies working copies only at the
        user's request.</p>
<p>To bring her project up to date, Sally can ask Subversion
        to <em class="firstterm">update</em> her working copy, by using
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command.  This will incorporate
        your changes into her working copy, as well as any others that
        have been committed since she checked it out.</p>
<pre class="screen">
$ pwd
/home/sally/calc

$ ls -A
Makefile button.c integer.c .svn/

$ svn update
U    button.c
Updated to revision 57.
</pre>
<p>The output from the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command
        indicates that Subversion updated the contents of
        <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  Note that Sally didn't need to
        specify which files to update; Subversion uses the information
        in the <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory as well as further
        information in the repository, to decide which files need to
        be brought up to date.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.revs"></a>1.3.3. Revisions</h3></div></div></div>
<p>An <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> operation publishes
        changes to any number of files and directories as a single
        atomic transaction.  In your working copy, you can change
        files' contents; create, delete, rename, and copy files and
        directories; and then commit a complete set of changes as an
        atomic transaction.</p>
<p>By atomic transaction, we mean simply this: either all of
        the changes happen in the repository, or none of them happens.
        Subversion tries to retain this atomicity in the face of
        program crashes, system crashes, network problems, and other
        users' actions.</p>
<p>Each time the repository accepts a commit, this creates a
        new state of the filesystem tree, called a
        <em class="firstterm">revision</em>.  Each revision is assigned a
        unique natural number, one greater than the number of the
        previous revision.  The initial revision of a freshly created
        repository is numbered 0 and consists of nothing but an
        empty root directory.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1" title="Figure 1.7. The repository">Figure 1.7, “The repository”</a> illustrates a nice way to
        visualize the repository.  Imagine an array of revision
        numbers, starting at 0, stretching from left to right.  Each
        revision number has a filesystem tree hanging below it, and
        each tree is a “<span class="quote">snapshot</span>” of the way the
        repository looked after a commit.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 1.7. The repository</b></p>
<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="images/ch02dia7.png" alt="The repository"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><div class="sidebar">
<p class="title"><b>Global Revision Numbers</b></p>
<p>Unlike most version control systems, Subversion's
          revision numbers apply to <span class="emphasis"><em>entire trees</em></span>,
          not individual files.  Each revision number selects an
          entire tree, a particular state of the repository after some
          committed change.  Another way to think about it is that
          revision N represents the state of the repository filesystem
          after the Nth commit.  When Subversion users talk
          about “<span class="quote">revision 5 of
          <code class="filename">foo.c</code>,</span>” they really mean
          “<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in revision
          5.</span>” Notice that in general, revisions N and M of a
          file do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> necessarily differ!  Many
          other version control systems use per-file revision numbers,
          so this concept may seem unusual at first. (Former CVS users
          might want to see <a class="xref" href="svn.forcvs.html" title="Appendix B. Subversion for CVS Users">Appendix B, <i>Subversion for CVS Users</i></a> for more
          details.)</p>
</div>
<p>It's important to note that working copies do not always
        correspond to any single revision in the repository; they may
        contain files from several different revisions.  For example,
        suppose you check out a working copy from a repository whose
        most recent revision is 4:</p>
<pre class="screen">
calc/Makefile:4
     integer.c:4
     button.c:4
</pre>
<p>At the moment, this working directory corresponds exactly
        to revision 4 in the repository.  However, suppose you make a
        change to <code class="filename">button.c</code>, and commit that
        change.  Assuming no other commits have taken place, your
        commit will create revision 5 of the repository, and your
        working copy will now look like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
calc/Makefile:4
     integer.c:4
     button.c:5
</pre>
<p>Suppose that, at this point, Sally commits a change to
        <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, creating revision 6.  If you
        use <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working copy
        up to date, it will look like this:</p>
<pre class="screen">
calc/Makefile:6
     integer.c:6
     button.c:6
</pre>
<p>Sally's change to <code class="filename">integer.c</code> will
        appear in your working copy, and your change will still be
        present in <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  In this example,
        the text of <code class="filename">Makefile</code> is identical in
        revisions 4, 5, and 6, but Subversion will mark your working
        copy of <code class="filename">Makefile</code> with revision 6 to
        indicate that it is still current.  So, after you do a clean
        update at the top of your working copy, it will generally
        correspond to exactly one revision in the repository.</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.track-repos"></a>1.3.4. How Working Copies Track the Repository</h3></div></div></div>
<p>For each file in a working directory, Subversion records
        two essential pieces of information in the
        <code class="filename">.svn/</code> administrative area:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>What revision your working file is based on (this is
            called the file's <em class="firstterm">working
            revision</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>A timestamp recording when the local copy was last
            updated by the repository</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Given this information, by talking to the repository,
        Subversion can tell which of the following four states a
        working file is in:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl>
<dt><span class="term">Unchanged, and current</span></dt>
<dd><p>The file is unchanged in the working directory, and
              no changes to that file have been committed to the
              repository since its working revision.  An <span class="command"><strong>svn
              commit</strong></span> of the file will do nothing, and an
              <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> of the file will do
              nothing.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">Locally changed, and current</span></dt>
<dd><p>The file has been changed in the working directory,
              and no changes to that file have been committed to the
              repository since you last updated.  There are local
              changes that have not been committed to the repository;
              thus an <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> of the file will
              succeed in publishing your changes, and an <span class="command"><strong>svn
              update</strong></span> of the file will do nothing.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">Unchanged, and out of date</span></dt>
<dd><p>The file has not been changed in the working
              directory, but it has been changed in the repository.
              The file should eventually be updated in order to make
              it current with the latest public revision.
              An <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> of the file will do
              nothing, and an
              <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> of the file will fold the
              latest changes into your working copy.</p></dd>
<dt><span class="term">Locally changed, and out of date</span></dt>
<dd><p>The file has been changed both in the working
              directory and in the repository.  An <span class="command"><strong>svn
              commit</strong></span> of the file will fail with an
              “<span class="quote">out-of-date</span>” error.  The file should be
              updated first; an <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command
              will attempt to merge the public changes with the local
              changes.  If Subversion can't complete the merge in a
              plausible way automatically, it leaves it to the user to
              resolve the conflict.</p></dd>
</dl></div>
<p>This may sound like a lot to keep track of, but the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> command will show you the state

<a name="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs"></a>1.3.5. Mixed Revision Working Copies</h3></div></div></div>
<p>As a general principle, Subversion tries to be as flexible
        as possible.  One special kind of flexibility is the ability
        to have a working copy containing files and directories with a
        mix of different working revision numbers.  Unfortunately,
        this flexibility tends to confuse a number of new users.  If
        the earlier example showing mixed revisions perplexed you,
        here's a primer on why the feature exists and how to make
        use of it.</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit"></a>1.3.5.1. Updates and commits are separate</h4></div></div></div>
<p>One of the fundamental rules of Subversion is that
          a “<span class="quote">push</span>” action does not cause
          a “<span class="quote">pull,</span>” nor vice versa.  Just
          because you're ready to submit new changes to the repository
          doesn't mean you're ready to receive changes from other
          people.  And if you have new changes still in progress,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> should gracefully merge
          repository changes into your own, rather than forcing you to
          publish them.</p>
<p>The main side effect of this rule is that it means a
          working copy has to do extra bookkeeping to track mixed
          revisions as well as be tolerant of the mixture.  It's made
          more complicated by the fact that directories themselves are
          versioned.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a working copy entirely at
          revision 10.  You edit the
          file <code class="filename">foo.html</code> and then perform
          an <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>, which creates revision 15
          in the repository.  After the commit succeeds, many new
          users would expect the working copy to be entirely at
          revision 15, but that's not the case!  Any number of changes
          might have happened in the repository between revisions 10
          and 15.  The client knows nothing of those changes in the
          repository, since you haven't yet run <span class="command"><strong>svn
          update</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> doesn't
          pull down new changes.  If, on the other hand,
          <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> were to automatically download
          the newest changes, it would be possible to set the
          entire working copy to revision 15—but then we'd be
          breaking the fundamental rule of “<span class="quote">push</span>”
          and “<span class="quote">pull</span>” remaining separate actions.
          Therefore, the only safe thing the Subversion client can do
          is mark the one
          file—<code class="filename">foo.html</code>—as being at
          revision 15.  The rest of the working copy remains at
          revision 10.  Only by running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
          can the latest changes be downloaded and the whole working
          copy be marked as revision 15.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.normal"></a>1.3.5.2. Mixed revisions are normal</h4></div></div></div>
<p>The fact is, <span class="emphasis"><em>every time</em></span> you run
          <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> your working copy ends up
          with some mixture of revisions.  The things you just
          committed are marked as having larger working revisions than
          everything else.  After several commits (with no updates
          in between), your working copy will contain a whole mixture
          of revisions.  Even if you're the only person using the
          repository, you will still see this phenomenon.  To examine
          your mixture of working revisions, use the <span class="command"><strong>svn
          status</strong></span> command with the <code class="option">--verbose</code> option (see <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.examine.status" title="2.4.3.1. See an overview of your changes">Section 2.4.3.1, “See an overview of your changes”</a> for more
          information).</p>
<p>Often, new users are completely unaware that their
          working copy contains mixed revisions.  This can be
          confusing, because many client commands are sensitive to the
          working revision of the item they're examining.  For
          example, the <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command is used to
          display the history of changes to a file or directory (see
          <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.history.html#svn.tour.history.log" title="2.5.1. Generating a List of Historical Changes">Section 2.5.1, “Generating a List of Historical Changes”</a>).  When the user
          invokes this command on a working copy object, he expects
          to see the entire history of the object.  But if the
          object's working revision is quite old (often because
          <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> hasn't been run in a long
          time), the history of the <span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span>
          version of the object is shown.</p>

<p>If your project is sufficiently complex, you'll discover
          that it's sometimes nice to
          forcibly <em class="firstterm">backdate</em> (or update to a
          revision older than the one you already have) portions of
          your working copy to an earlier revision; you'll learn how
          to do that in <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.html" title="Chapter 2. Basic Usage">Chapter 2, <i>Basic Usage</i></a>.  Perhaps you'd
          like to test an earlier version of a submodule contained in
          a subdirectory, or perhaps you'd like to figure out when a
          bug first came into existence in a specific file.  This is
          the “<span class="quote">time machine</span>” aspect of a version control
          system—the feature that allows you to move any
          portion of your working copy forward and backward in
          history.</p>

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title">
<a name="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.limits"></a>1.3.5.4. Mixed revisions have limitations</h4></div></div></div>
<p>However you make use of mixed revisions in your working
          copy, there are limitations to this flexibility.</p>
<p>First, you cannot commit the deletion of a file or
          directory that isn't fully up to date.  If a newer version
          of the item exists in the repository, your attempt to delete
          will be rejected to prevent you from accidentally
          destroying changes you've not yet seen.</p>
<p>Second, you cannot commit a metadata change to a
          directory unless it's fully up to date.  You'll learn about
          attaching “<span class="quote">properties</span>” to items in <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html" title="Chapter 3. Advanced Topics">Chapter 3, <i>Advanced Topics</i></a>.  A directory's working revision
          defines a specific set of entries and properties, and thus
          committing a property change to an out-of-date directory may
          destroy properties you've not yet seen.</p>
