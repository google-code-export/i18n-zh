      <p>The interface between Subversion and external two- and three-way
      differencing tools harkens back to a time when Subversion's only
      contextual differencing capabilities were built around
      invocations of the GNU diffutils toolchain, specifically the
      <span class="command"><strong>diff</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>diff3</strong></span> utilities.
      To get the kind of behavior Subversion needed, it called these
      utilities with more than a handful of options and parameters,
      most of which were quite specific to the utilities.  Some time
      later, Subversion grew its own internal differencing library,
      and as a failover mechanism, the <code class="option">--diff-cmd</code> and
      <code class="option">--diff3-cmd</code> options were added to the
      Subversion command-line client so that users could more easily
      indicate that they preferred to use the GNU diff and diff3
      utilities instead of the newfangled internal diff library.  If
      those options were used, Subversion would simply ignore the
      internal diff library, and fall back to running those external
      programs, lengthy argument lists and all.  And that's where
      things remain today.</p>
      <p>It didn't take long for folks to realize that having such
      easy configuration mechanisms for specifying that Subversion
      should use the external GNU diff and diff3 utilities located at
      a particular place on the system could be applied toward the use
      of other differencing tools, too.  After all, Subversion didn't
      actually verify that the things it was being told to run were
      members of the GNU diffutils toolchain.  But the only
      configurable aspect of using those external tools is their
      location on the system&#8212;not the option set, parameter
      order, and so on.  Subversion continues to throw all those GNU utility
      options at your external diff tool regardless of whether
      that program can understand those options.  And that's where
      things get unintuitive for most users.</p>

        <p>The decision on when to fire off a contextual two- or three-way
        diff as part of a larger Subversion operation is made entirely
        by Subversion and is affected by, among other things, whether
        the files being operated on are human-readable as
        determined by their <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.
        This means, for example, that even if you had the niftiest
        Microsoft Word-aware differencing or merging tool in the
        universe, it would never be invoked by Subversion as long as
        your versioned Word documents had a configured MIME type that
        denoted that they were not human-readable (such as
        <code class="literal">application/msword</code>).  For more about MIME
        type settings, see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="&#25991;&#20214;&#20869;&#23481;&#31867;&#22411;">&#8220;&#25991;&#20214;&#20869;&#23481;&#31867;&#22411;&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a></p>
      </div>
      <p>Subversion 1.5 introduces interactive resolution of
      conflicts (described in <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve" title="&#35299;&#20915;&#20914;&#31361;(&#21512;&#24182;&#21035;&#20154;&#30340;&#20462;&#25913;)">&#8220;&#35299;&#20915;&#20914;&#31361;(&#21512;&#24182;&#21035;&#20154;&#30340;&#20462;&#25913;)&#8221;&#19968;&#33410;</a>), and one of the options provided to users is the ability to
      launch a third-party merge tool.  If this action is taken,
      Subversion will consult the <code class="literal">merge-tool-cmd</code>
      runtime configuration option to find the name of an external
      merge tool and, upon finding one, will launch that tool with the
      appropriate input files.  This differs from the configurable
      three-way differencing tool in a couple of ways.  First, the
      differencing tool is always used to handle three-way
      differences, whereas the merge tool is employed only when
      three-way difference application has detected a conflict.
      Second, the interface is much cleaner&#8212;your configured
      merge tool need only accept as command-line parameters four path
      specifications:  the base file, the &#8220;<span class="quote">theirs</span>&#8221; file
      (which contains upstream changes), the &#8220;<span class="quote">mine</span>&#8221; file
      (which contains local modifications), and the path of the file
      where the final resolved contents should be stored.</p>

        <p>Subversion calls external diff programs with parameters
        suitable for the GNU diff utility, and expects only that the
        external program will return with a successful error code.  For
        most alternative diff programs, only the sixth and seventh
        arguments&#8212;the paths of the files that represent the left and
        right sides of the diff, respectively&#8212;are of interest.  Note
        that Subversion runs the diff program once per modified file
        covered by the Subversion operation, so if your program runs
        in an asynchronous fashion (or is &#8220;<span class="quote">backgrounded</span>&#8221;),
        you might have several instances of it all running
        simultaneously.  Finally, Subversion expects that your program
        return an error code of 1 if your program detected differences,
        or 0 if it did not&#8212;any other error code is considered a
        fatal error.
