</pre><p>DAV Explorer is another standalone WebDAV client, written
          in Java.  It's under a free Apache-like license and is
          available at <code class="uri">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/</code>.
          It does everything cadaver does, but has the
          advantages of being portable and being a more user-friendly GUI
          application.  It's also one of the first clients to support
          the new WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744).</p><p>Of course, DAV Explorer's ACL support is useless in this
          case, since <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> doesn't support
          it.  The fact that both cadaver and DAV Explorer support
          some limited DeltaV commands isn't particularly useful
          either, since they don't allow <code class="literal">MKACTIVITY</code>
          requests.  But it's not relevant anyway; we're assuming all
          of these clients are operating against an autoversioning
          repository.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions"></a>File-Explorer WebDAV Extensions</h3></div></div></div><p>Some popular file explorer GUI programs support WebDAV
        extensions that allow a user to browse a DAV share as if it
        was just another directory on the local computer, and to
        perform basic tree editing operations on the items in that
        share.  For example, Windows Explorer is able to browse a
        WebDAV server as a &#8220;<span class="quote">network place.</span>&#8221;  Users can
        drag files to and from the desktop, or can rename, copy, or
        delete files in the usual way.  But because it's only a
        feature of the file-explorer, the DAV share isn't visible to
        ordinary applications.  All DAV interaction must happen
        through the explorer interface.</p><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions.windows"></a>Microsoft Web &#25991;&#20214;&#22841;</h4></div></div></div><p>Microsoft was one of the original backers of the WebDAV
          specification, and first started shipping a client in
          Windows 98, which was known as Web Folders.  This client was
          also shipped in Windows NT4 and 2000.</p><p>The original Web Folders client was an extension to
          Explorer, the main GUI program used to browse filesystems.  It
          works well enough.  In Windows 98, the feature might need to
          be explicitly installed if Web Folders aren't already visible
          inside My Computer.  In Windows 2000, simply
          add a new &#8220;<span class="quote">network place</span>&#8221;, enter the URL, and the
          WebDAV share will pop up for browsing.</p><p>With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft started shipping
          a new implementation of Web Folders, known as the WebDAV
          Mini-Redirector.  The new implementation is a
          filesystem-level client, allowing WebDAV shares to be mounted
          as drive letters.  Unfortunately, this implementation is
          incredibly buggy.  The client usually tries to convert http
          URLs (<code class="literal">http://host/repos</code>) into UNC share
          notation (<code class="literal">\\host\repos</code>); it also often
          tries to use Windows Domain authentication to respond to
          basic-auth HTTP challenges, sending usernames as
          <code class="literal">HOST\username</code>.  These interoperability
          problems are severe and documented in numerous places around
          the Web, to the frustration of many users.  Even Greg Stein,
          the original author of Apache's WebDAV module, bluntly
          states that XP Web Folders simply can't operate against an Apache
          server.</p><p>Windows Vista's implementation of Web Folders seems to
          be almost the same as XP's, so it has the same sort of
          problems (at the time of writing).</p><p>However, there seem to be workarounds for both XP and
          Vista that allow Web Folders to work against Apache.  Users
          have mostly reported success with these techniques, so we'll
          relay them here.</p><p>On Windows XP, you have two options.  First, search
          Microsoft's web site for update KB90730, &#8220;<span class="quote">Software
          Update for Web Folders.</span>&#8221;  This may fix all your
          problems.  If it doesn't, it seems that the original pre-XP
          Web Folders implementation is still buried within the
          system.  You can unearth it by going to Network
          Places and adding a new network place.  When prompted,
          enter the URL of the repository, but <span class="emphasis"><em>include a
          port number</em></span> in the URL.  For
          example, <code class="uri">http://host/repos</code> should be
          entered as <code class="uri">http://host:80/repos</code> instead.
          Respond to any authentication prompts with your Subversion
          credentials.</p><p>On Windows Vista, the same KB90730 update may clear
          everything up.  But there may still be other issues.  Some
          users have reported that Vista considers
          all <code class="literal">http://</code> connections insecure, and thus
          will always fail any authentication challenges from Apache
          unless the connection happens
          over <code class="literal">https://</code>.  If you're unable to connect
          to the Subversion repository via SSL, you can tweak the
          system registry to turn off this behavior.  Just set the
          key <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel</code>
          from 1 to 2.  A final warning: be sure to set up the Web
          Folder to point to the repository's root directory
          (<code class="filename">/</code>), rather than some subdirectory
          such as <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  Vista Web Folders
          seems to work only against repository roots.</p><p>In general, while these workarounds may function for
          you, you might get a better overall experience using a
          third-party WebDAV client such as WebDrive or NetDrive.</p></div><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="svn.webdav.clients.file-explorer-extensions.linux-de"></a>Nautilus&#65292;Konqueror</h4></div></div></div><p>Nautilus is the official file manager/browser for the

        sort of WebDAV client.  It's implemented as a low-level
        filesystem module, typically within the operating system's
        kernel.  This means that the DAV share is mounted like any
        other network filesystem, similar to mounting an NFS share on
        Unix or attaching an SMB share as drive letter in Windows.
        As a result, this sort of client provides completely
        transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs.
        Applications aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are
        happening.</p><div class="section" lang="zh-cn"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="svn.webdav.clients.fs-impl.windows"></a>WebDrive&#65292;NetDrive</h4></div></div></div><p>Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial
          products that allow a WebDAV share to be attached as drive
          letters in Windows.  As a result, you can operate on the
          contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudo-drives as easily as
          you can against real local hard drives, and in the same
          ways.  WebDrive can be purchased from South River
          Technologies (<code class="uri">http://www.southrivertech.com</code>).
          Novell's NetDrive is freely available online, but requires
