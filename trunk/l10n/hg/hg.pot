"control access to a repository using simple hooks\n"
"\n"
"This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to portions\n"
"of a repository when receiving incoming changesets.\n"
"\n"
"The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the\n"
"system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original\n"
"changeset (since the latter is merely informative).\n"
"\n"
"The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh,\n"
"preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than\n"
"pushing or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have\n"
"interactive shell access, as they can then disable the hook.\n"
"Nor is it safe if remote users share an account, because then there\n"
"is no way to distinguish them.\n"
"\n"
"To use this hook, configure the acl extension in your hgrc like this:\n"
"\n"
"  [extensions]\n"
"  hgext.acl =\n"

"  pretxnchangegroup.acl = python:hgext.acl.hook\n"

"  # (\"serve\" == ssh or http, \"push\", \"pull\", \"bundle\")\n"
"  sources = serve\n"
"\n"
"The allow and deny sections take a subtree pattern as key (with a\n"
"glob syntax by default), and a comma separated list of users as\n"
"the corresponding value. The deny list is checked before the allow\n"
"list is.\n"

"\n"
"This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets\n"

"\n"
"The hook updates the Bugzilla database directly. Only Bugzilla\n"

"subsequent versions by 'config/sendbugmail.pl'. Note that these will\n"
"be run by Mercurial as the user pushing the change; you will need to\n"
"ensure the Bugzilla install file permissions are set appropriately.\n"

"    for source SCMs that use unix logins to identify authors (eg:\n"
"    CVS). One line per author mapping and the line format is:\n"
"    srcauthor=whatever string you want\n"
"\n"
"    The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files\n"
"    and directories. Comment lines start with '#'. Each line can\n"
"    contain one of the following directives:\n"
"\n"
"      include path/to/file\n"
"\n"
"      exclude path/to/file\n"
"\n"
"      rename from/file to/file\n"
"\n"
"    The 'include' directive causes a file, or all files under a\n"
"    directory, to be included in the destination repository, and the\n"
"    exclusion of all other files and directories not explicitly included.\n"
"    The 'exclude' directive causes files or directories to be omitted.\n"
"    The 'rename' directive renames a file or directory. To rename from\n"
"    a subdirectory into the root of the repository, use '.' as the\n"
"    path to rename to.\n"
"\n"
"    The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic\n"
"    history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is\n"
"    useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or\n"
"    graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry\n"
"    contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two\n"
"    comma-separated values. The key is the revision ID in the source\n"
"    revision control system whose parents should be modified (same\n"
"    format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs\n"
"    (in either the source or destination revision control system) that\n"
"    should be used as the new parents for that node.\n"
"\n"
"    The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is\n"
"    being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in\n"
"    conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination\n"
"    to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them\n"
"    into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains\n"
"    lines of the form \"original_branch_name new_branch_name\".\n"
"    \"original_branch_name\" is the name of the branch in the source\n"
"    repository, and \"new_branch_name\" is the name of the branch is the\n"
"    destination repository. This can be used to (for instance) move code\n"
"    in one repository from \"default\" to a named branch.\n"
"\n"
"    Mercurial Source\n"
"    -----------------\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.hg.ignoreerrors=False    (boolean)\n"
"        ignore integrity errors when reading. Use it to fix Mercurial\n"
"        repositories with missing revlogs, by converting from and to\n"
"        Mercurial.\n"
"    --config convert.hg.saverev=False         (boolean)\n"
"        store original revision ID in changeset (forces target IDs to\n"
"        change)\n"
"    --config convert.hg.startrev=0            (hg revision identifier)\n"
"        convert start revision and its descendants\n"
"\n"
"    CVS Source\n"
"    ----------\n"
"\n"
"    CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked-out copy) from CVS\n"
"    to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct\n"
"    access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the\n"
"    repository is :local:. The conversion uses the top level directory\n"
"    in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses CVS rlog\n"
"    commands to find files to convert. This means that unless a\n"
"    filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be\n"
"    converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS\n"
"    sandbox is ignored.\n"
"\n"
"    Because CVS does not have changesets, it is necessary to collect\n"
"    individual commits to CVS and merge them into changesets. CVS\n"
"    source uses its internal changeset merging code by default but can\n"
"    be configured to call the external 'cvsps' program by setting:\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps='cvsps -A -u --cvs-direct -q'\n"
"    This option is deprecated and will be removed in Mercurial 1.4.\n"
"\n"
"    The options shown are the defaults.\n"
"\n"
"    Internal cvsps is selected by setting\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps=builtin\n"
"    and has a few more configurable options:\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.cache=True     (boolean)\n"
"            Set to False to disable remote log caching, for testing and\n"
"            debugging purposes.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.fuzz=60        (integer)\n"
"            Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is allowed\n"
"            between commits with identical user and log message in a\n"
"            single changeset. When very large files were checked in as\n"
"            part of a changeset then the default may not be long\n"
"            enough.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.mergeto='{{mergetobranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"            Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages\n"
"            are matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion\n"
"            process will insert a dummy revision merging the branch on\n"
"            which this log message occurs to the branch indicated in\n"
"            the regex.\n"
"        --config convert.cvsps.mergefrom='{{mergefrombranch ([-\\w]+)}}'\n"
"            Specify a regular expression to which commit log messages\n"
"            are matched. If a match occurs, then the conversion\n"
"            process will add the most recent revision on the branch\n"
"            indicated in the regex as the second parent of the\n"
"            changeset.\n"
"\n"
"    The hgext/convert/cvsps wrapper script allows the builtin\n"
"    changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its\n"
"    parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1.\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion Source\n"
"    -----------------\n"
"\n"
"    Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.\n"
"    By default, the supplied \"svn://repo/path/\" source URL is\n"
"    converted as a single branch. If \"svn://repo/path/trunk\" exists it\n"
"    replaces the default branch. If \"svn://repo/path/branches\" exists,\n"
"    its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If\n"
"    \"svn://repo/path/tags\" exists, it is looked for tags referencing\n"
"    converted branches. Default \"trunk\", \"branches\" and \"tags\" values\n"
"    can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths\n"
"    relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto\n"
"    detection.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.branches=branches    (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing branches\n"
"    --config convert.svn.tags=tags            (directory name)\n"
"        specify the directory containing tags\n"
"    --config convert.svn.trunk=trunk          (directory name)\n"
"        specify the name of the trunk branch\n"
"\n"
"    Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,\n"
"    instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch\n"
"    conversions are supported.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.svn.startrev=0           (svn revision number)\n"
"        specify start Subversion revision.\n"
"\n"
"    Perforce Source\n"
"    ---------------\n"
"\n"
"    The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a\n"
"    client specification as source. It will convert all files in the\n"
"    source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches\n"
"    and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then\n"
"    usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the\n"
"    target may be named ...-hg.\n"
"\n"
"    It is possible to limit the amount of source history to be\n"
"    converted by specifying an initial Perforce revision.\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.p4.startrev=0            (perforce changelist number)\n"
"        specify initial Perforce revision.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"    Mercurial Destination\n"
"    ---------------------\n"
"\n"
"    --config convert.hg.clonebranches=False   (boolean)\n"
"        dispatch source branches in separate clones.\n"
"    --config convert.hg.tagsbranch=default    (branch name)\n"
"        tag revisions branch name\n"

"\n"

"    activate extensions as needed.\n"
"\n"
"    To enable the \"foo\" extension, either shipped with Mercurial\n"

"    Valid URLs are of the form:\n"
"\n"
"      local/filesystem/path (or file://local/filesystem/path)\n"

"      https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]\n"
"      ssh://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path]\n"
"\n"
"    Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial\n"
"    repositories or to bundle files (as created by 'hg bundle' or\n"
"    'hg incoming --bundle').\n"
"\n"
"    An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag,\n"
"    or changeset to use from the remote repository.\n"
"\n"
"    Some features, such as pushing to http:// and https:// URLs are\n"
"    only possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote\n"
"    Mercurial server.\n"
"\n"
"    Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:\n"
"    - SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination\n"
"      machine and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with as\n"
"      remotecmd.\n"
"    - path is relative to the remote user's home directory by default.\n"
"      Use an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute "
"path:\n"
"        ssh://example.com//tmp/repository\n"
"    - Mercurial doesn't use its own compression via SSH; the right\n"
"      thing to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:\n"
"        Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com\n"
"          Compression no\n"
"        Host *\n"
"          Compression yes\n"
"      Alternatively specify \"ssh -C\" as your ssh command in your hgrc\n"
"      or with the --ssh command line option.\n"
"\n"
"    These URLs can all be stored in your hgrc with path aliases under\n"
"    the [paths] section like so:\n"
"    [paths]\n"
"    alias1 = URL1\n"
"    alias2 = URL2\n"
"    ...\n"
"\n"
"    You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for\n"
"    example 'hg pull alias1' would pull from the 'alias1' path).\n"
"\n"
"    Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults\n"
"    when you do not provide the URL to a command:\n"
"\n"
"    default:\n"
"      When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command\n"
"      saves the location of the source repository as the new\n"
"      repository's 'default' path. This is then used when you omit\n"
"      path from push- and pull-like commands (including incoming and\n"
"      outgoing).\n"
"\n"
"    default-push:\n"
"      The push command will look for a path named 'default-push', and\n"
"      prefer it over 'default' if both are defined.\n"
