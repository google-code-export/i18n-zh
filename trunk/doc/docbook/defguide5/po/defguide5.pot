The DocBook definition of a book is very loose and general. Given the variety of books authored with DocBook and the number of different conventions for book organization used in countries around the world, attempting to impose a strict ordering of elements can make the content model extremely complex. But DocBook gives you free reign. It's very reasonable to use a local <xref linkend=\"app-customizing\"/> to impose a more strict ordering for your applications."
