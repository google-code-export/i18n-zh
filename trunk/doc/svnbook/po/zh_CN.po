msgid "The problem with such FAQs is that they are not, in a literal sense, FAQs at all. No one ever called the tech support line and asked, <quote>How can we maximize productivity?</quote>. Rather, people asked highly specific questions, like, <quote>How can we change the calendaring system to send reminders two days in advance instead of one?</quote> and so on. But it's a lot easier to make up imaginary Frequently Asked Questions than it is to discover the real ones. Compiling a true FAQ sheet requires a sustained, organized effort: over the lifetime of the software, incoming questions must be tracked, responses monitored, and all gathered into a coherent, searchable whole that reflects the collective experience of users in the wild. It calls for the patient, observant attitude of a field naturalist. No grand hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here—open eyes and accurate note-taking are what's needed most."

The manual made no pretense of being complete, but it was distributed with Subversion and got users over that initial hump in the learning curve. When O'Reilly and Associates decided to publish a full-length Subversion book, the path of least resistance was obvious: just expand the Subversion handbook."
msgstr "日复一日看到相同问题的烦闷，促使Ben在2002年的夏天努力工作了一个月，撰写了一本<citetitle>Subversion手册</citetitle>，一本六十页厚的、涵盖了所有Subversion使用基础知识的手册。这本手册没有说明最终定稿的时间，但它随着Subversion的每个版本一起发布，帮助许多用户跨过学习之初的艰难。当O'Reilly和Associates决定出版一本完备的Subversion图书的时候，一条捷径浮出水面：扩充Subversion手册。"

msgid "The three co-authors of the new book were thus presented with an unusual opportunity. Officially, their task was to write a book top-down, starting from a table of contents and an initial draft. But they also had access to a steady stream—indeed, an uncontrollable geyser—of bottom-up source material. Subversion was already in the hands of thousands of early adopters, and those users were giving tons of feedback, not only about Subversion, but about its existing documentation."
msgstr "新书的三位合著者因而面临着一个不寻常的机会。从职责上讲，他们的任务是从一个目录和一些草稿为基础，自上而下的写一部专著。但事实上，他们的灵感源泉则来自一些具体的内容，稳定却难以组织。Subversion被数以千计的早期用户采用，这些用户提供了大量的反馈，不仅仅针对Subversion，还包括业已存在的文档。"

msgid "During the entire time they wrote this book, Ben, Mike, and Brian haunted the Subversion mailing lists and chat rooms incessantly, carefully noting the problems users were having in real-life situations. Monitoring such feedback was part of their job descriptions at CollabNet anyway, and it gave them a huge advantage when they set out to document Subversion. The book they produced is grounded firmly in the bedrock of experience, not in the shifting sands of wishful thinking; it combines the best aspects of user manual and FAQ sheet. This duality might not be noticeable on a first reading. Taken in order, front to back, the book is simply a straightforward description of a piece of software. There's the overview, the obligatory guided tour, the chapter on administrative configuration, some advanced topics, and of course a command reference and troubleshooting guide. Only when you come back to it later, seeking the solution to some specific problem, does its authenticity shine out: the telling details that can only result from encounters with the unexpected, the examples honed from genuine use cases, and most of all the sensitivity to the user's needs and the user's point of view."
msgstr "在写这本书的过程里，Ben，Mike 和 Brian一直像鬼魂一样游荡在Subversion邮件列表和聊天室中，仔细的研究用户实际遇到的问题。监视这些反馈也是他们在CollabNet工作的一部分，这给他们撰写Subversion文档提供了巨大的便利。这本书建立在丰富的使用经验，而非在流沙般脆弱的想象之上，它结合了用户手册和FAQ的优点。初次阅读时，这种二元性的优势并不明显，按照顺序，从前到后，这本书只是简单的从头到尾描述了软件的细节。书中的内容包括一章概述，一章必不可少的快速指南，一章关于管理配置，一些高级主题，当然还包括命令参考手册和故障排除指南。而当你过一段时间之后，再次翻开本书查找一些特定问题的解决方案时，这种二元性才得以显现：这些生动的细节一定来自不可预测的实际用例的提炼，大多是源于用户的需要和视点。"

While the result isn't necessarily the next great evolution in version control design, Subversion <emphasis>is</emphasis> very powerful, very usable, and very flexible.

Most books tend to be written for one type of person or the other, and this book is undoubtedly biased towards top-down learners.

CollabNet offers a collaboration software suite called CollabNet Enterprise Edition (CEE) of which one component is version control.

Unfortunately, CVS had become the de facto standard in the open source world largely because there <emphasis>wasn't</emphasis> anything better, at least not under a free license.

Coincidentally, at the time Karl was already discussing a design for a new version control system with his friend Jim Blandy. In 1995, the two had started Cyclic Software, a company providing CVS support contracts, and although they later sold the business, they still used CVS every day at their jobs. Their frustration with CVS had led Jim to think carefully about better ways to manage versioned data, and he'd already come up with not only the name <quote>Subversion</quote>, but also with the basic design of the Subversion data store. When CollabNet called, Karl immediately agreed to work on the project, and Jim got his employer, Red Hat Software, to essentially donate him to the project for an indefinite period of time. CollabNet hired Karl and Ben Collins-Sussman, and detailed design work began in May. With the help of some well-placed prods from Brian Behlendorf and Jason Robbins of CollabNet, and Greg Stein (at the time an independent developer active in the WebDAV/DeltaV specification process), Subversion quickly attracted a community of active developers. It turned out that many people had had the same frustrating experiences with CVS, and welcomed the chance to finally do something about it."

Any number of changes might have happened in the repository between revisions 10 and 15. The client knows nothing of those changes in the repository, since you haven't yet run <command>svn update</command>, and <command>svn commit</command> doesn't pull down new changes. If, on the other hand, <command>svn commit</command><emphasis>were</emphasis> to automatically download the newest changes, then it would be possible to set the entire working copy to revision 15—but then we'd be breaking the fundamental rule of <quote>push</quote> and <quote>pull</quote> remaining separate actions. Therefore the only safe thing the Subversion client can do is mark the one file—<filename>foo.html</filename>—as being at revision 15. The rest of the working copy remains at revision 10. Only by running <command>svn update</command> can the latest changes be downloaded, and the whole working copy be marked as revision 15."

Finally, Subversion removes the log file. Architecturally, this is similar to a journaled filesystem. If a Subversion operation is interrupted (if the process is killed, or if the machine crashes, for example), the log files remain on disk.

Of course, if Subversion guesses incorrectly, or if you wish to set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property to something more precise—perhaps <literal>image/png</literal> or <literal>application/x-shockwave-flash</literal>—you can always remove or edit that property.

For example, you might create a mapping that says that any time you add JPEG files—ones whose names match the pattern <literal>*.jpg</literal>—Subversion should automatically set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on those files to <literal>image/jpeg</literal>. Or perhaps any files that match <literal>*.cpp</literal> should have <literal>svn:eol-style</literal> set to <literal>native</literal>, and <literal>svn:keywords</literal> set to <literal>Id</literal>.

msgid "Subversion's copy-modify-merge version control model lives and dies on its data merging algorithms, specifically on how well those algorithms perform when trying to resolve conflicts caused by multiple users modifying the same file concurrently. Subversion itself provides only one such algorithm, a three-way differencing algorithm which is smart enough to handle data at a granularity of a single line of text. Subversion also allows you to supplement its content merge processing with external differencing utilities (as described in <xref linkend=\"svn.advanced.externaldifftools.diff3\"/>), some of which may do an even better job, perhaps providing granularity of a word or a single character of text. But common among those algorithms is that they generally work only on text files. The landscape starts to look pretty grim when you start talking about content merges of non-textual file formats. And when you can't find a tool that can handle that type of merging, you begin to run into problems with the copy-modify-merge model."

You can create or modify this property using <command>svn propset</command> or <command>svn propedit</command> (see <xref linkend=\"svn.advanced.props.manip\"/>). It can be set on any versioned directory, and its value is a multi-line table of subdirectories (relative to the versioned directory on which the property is set), optional revision flags, and fully qualified, absolute Subversion repository URLs."
msgstr "很幸运，Subversion提供了<firstterm>外部定义</firstterm>的支持，一个外部定义是一个本地路经到URL的影射—也有可能一个特定的修订版本—一些版本化的资源。在Subversion你可以使用<literal>svn:externals</literal>属性来定义外部定义，你可以用<command>svn propset</command>或<command>svn propedit</command>（见<xref linkend=\"svn.advanced.props.manip\"/>）创建和修改这个属性。它可以设置到任何版本化的路经，它的值是一个多行的子目录，可选的修订版本标记和完全有效的Subversion版本库URL的列表（相对于设置属性的版本化目录）。"

msgid "There are two important lessons that you should remember from this section. First, Subversion has no internal concept of a branch—it only knows how to make copies. When you copy a directory, the resulting directory is only a <quote>branch</quote> because <emphasis>you</emphasis> attach that meaning to it. You may think of the directory differently, or treat it differently, but to Subversion it's just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some extra historical information."
msgstr "在本节，你需要记住两件重要的课程。首先，Subversion并没有内在的分支概念—只有拷贝，当你拷贝一个目录，这个结果目录就是一个<quote>分支</quote>，只是因为你给了它这样一个含义而已。你可以换一种角度考虑，或者特别对待，但是对于Subversion它只是一个普通的拷贝，只不过碰巧包含了一些额外的历史信息。第二，因为拷贝机制，Subversion的分支是以<emphasis>普通文件系统目录</emphasis>存在的，这与其他版本控制系统不同，它们都为分支定义了另一维度的<quote>标签</quote>。"

#. (para)
#: ../source/book.xml:7101
msgid "Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's branches exist as <emphasis>normal filesystem directories</emphasis> in the repository. This is different from other version control systems, where branches are typically defined by adding extra-dimensional <quote>labels</quote> to collections of files. The location of your branch directory doesn't matter to Subversion. Most teams follow a convention of putting all branches into a <filename>/branches</filename> directory, but you're free to invent any policy you wish."

msgid "In Subversion, a global revision number N names a tree in the repository: it's the way the repository looked after the Nth commit. It's also the name of an implicit changeset: if you compare tree N with tree N-1, you can derive the exact patch that was committed. For this reason, it's easy to think of <quote>revision N</quote> as not just a tree, but a changeset as well. If you use an issue tracker to manage bugs, you can use the revision numbers to refer to particular patches that fix bugs—for example, <quote>this issue was fixed by revision 9238.</quote>. Somebody can then run <command>svn log -r9238</command> to read about the exact changeset which fixed the bug, and run <command>svn diff -c 9238</command> to see the patch itself. And Subversion's <literal>merge</literal> command also uses revision numbers. You can merge specific changesets from one branch to another by naming them in the merge arguments: <command>svn merge -c 9238</command> would merge changeset #9238 into your working copy."

Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server process that mediates all access to tables. If a program accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess left behind. And because the database daemon is the only process accessing the tables, applications don't need to worry about permission conflicts. These things are not the case with Berkeley DB, however. Subversion (and programs using Subversion libraries) access the database tables directly, which means that a program crash can leave the database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state. When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance. Other things can cause a repository to <quote>wedge</quote> besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over ownership and permissions on the database files."

Deltification involves encoding the representation of a chunk of data as a collection of differences against some other chunk of data. If the two pieces of data are very similar, this deltification results in storage savings for the deltified chunk—rather than taking up space equal to the size of the original data, it takes up only enough space to say, <quote>I look just like this other piece of data over here, except for the following couple of changes</quote>. The result is that most of the repository data that tends to be bulky—namely, the contents of versioned files—is stored at a much smaller size than the original <quote>fulltext</quote> representation of that data. And for repositories created with Subversion 1.4 or later, the space savings are even better—now those fulltext representations of file contents are themselves compressed."
msgstr "为了尽可能减小版本库的体积，Subversion在版本库中采用了<firstterm>增量化技术</firstterm>（或称为<quote>增量存储技术</quote>）。增量化技术可以将一组数据表示为相对于另一组数据的不同。如果这两组数据十分相似，增量化技术就可以仅保存其中一组数据以及两组数据的差别，而不需要同时保存两组数据，从而节省了磁盘空间。每次一个文件的新版本提交到版本库，版本库就会将之前的版本（之前的多个版本）相对于新版本做增量化处理。采用了这项技术，版本库的数据量大小基本上是可以估算出来的—主要是版本化的文件的大小—并且远小于<quote>全文</quote>保存所需的数据量。而Subversion 1.4以后，空间存储变得更为节省—现在文件内容的全文本身都是压缩的了。"

#. (para)
#: ../source/book.xml:10519

Berkeley DB will, however, keep internal records of unused areas of the database file, and consume those areas first before growing the size of the database file. So while deltification doesn't produce immediate space savings, it can drastically slow future growth of the database."
msgstr "由于Subversion版本库的增量化数据保存在单一Berkeley DB数据库文件中，减少数据的体积并不一定能够减小数据库文件的大小。但是，Berkeley DB会在内部记录未使用的数据库文件区域，并且在增加数据库文件大小之前会首先使用这些未使用的区域。因此，即使增量化技术不能立杆见影的节省磁盘空间，也可以极大的减慢数据库的膨胀速度。"

It is possible that at some point in the lifetime of your repository, you might have copied a file or directory from some location that <command>svndumpfilter</command> is excluding, to a location that it is including. In order to make the dump data self-sufficient, <command>svndumpfilter</command> needs to still show the addition of the new path—including the contents of any files created by the copy—and not represent that addition as a copy from a source that won't exist in your filtered dump data stream.

If you suspect that you have any copies of this sort in your repository, you might want to rethink your set of included/excluded paths, perhaps including the paths that served as sources of your troublesome copy operations, too."

msgid "This behavior works identically on both Unix and Windows systems. Note, though, that while your operating system might have support for a certain locale, the Subversion client still may not be able to speak the particular language. In order to produce localized messages, human volunteers must provide translations for each language. The translations are written using the GNU gettext package, which results in translation modules that end with the <filename>.mo</filename> filename extension. For example, the German translation file is named <filename>de.mo</filename>. These translation files are installed somewhere on your system. On Unix, they typically live in <filename>/usr/share/locale/</filename>, while on Windows they're often found in the <filename>\\share\\locale\\</filename> folder in Subversion's installation area. Once installed, a module is named after the program it provides translations for. For example, the <filename>de.mo</filename> file may ultimately end up installed as <filename>/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</filename>. By browsing the installed <filename>.mo</filename> files, you can see which languages the Subversion client is able to speak."
msgstr "这个行为在Unix和Windows上同样工作，注意，尽管有时你的操作系统支持某个地区，Subversion客户端可能不能讲特定的语言。为了制作本地化信息，志愿者可以提供各种语言的翻译。翻译使用GNU gettext包编写，相关的翻译模块使用<filename>.mo</filename>作为后缀名。举个例子，德国翻译文件为<filename>de.mo</filename>。翻译文件安装到你的系统的某个位置，在Unix它们会在<filename>/usr/share/locale/</filename>，而在Windows它们通常会在Subversion安装的<filename>\\share\\locale\\</filename>目录。一旦安装，一个命名在程序后面的模块会为此提供翻译。举个例子，<filename>de.mo</filename>会最终安装到<filename>/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/subversion.mo</filename>，通过查看安装的<filename>.mo</filename>文件，我们可以看到Subversion支持的语言。"

The SWIG bindings for Subversion are located in <filename>subversion/bindings/swig</filename>. They are still maturing, but they are usable. These bindings allow you to call Subversion API functions indirectly, using wrappers that translate the datatypes native to your scripting language into the datatypes needed by Subversion's C libraries."

You can find links to these alternative bindings on the Subversion project's links page (at <uri href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html\">http://subversion.tigris.org/links.html</uri>), but there are a couple of popular ones we feel are especially noteworthy. First, Barry Scott's PySVN bindings (<uri href=\"http://pysvn.tigris.org/\">http://pysvn.tigris.org/</uri>) are a popular option for binding with Python. PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic interface than the more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's own Python bindings. For folks looking for a pure Java implementation of Subversion, check out SVNKit (<uri href=\"http://svnkit.com/\">http://svnkit.com/</uri>), which is Subversion re-written from the ground up in Java. You should exercise caution here, though—because SVNKit doesn't use the core Subversion libraries, it's behavior is not guaranteed to match that of Subversion itself."

msgid "<xref linkend=\"svn.developer.layerlib.repos.ex-1\"/> contains a code segment (written in C) that illustrates some of the concepts we've been discussing. It uses both the repository and filesystem interfaces (as can be determined by the prefixes <literal>svn_repos_</literal> and <literal>svn_fs_</literal> of the function names, respectively) to create a new revision in which a directory is added. You can see the use of an APR pool, which is passed around for memory allocation purposes. Also, the code reveals a somewhat obscure fact about Subversion error handling—all Subversion errors must be explicitly handled to avoid memory leakage (and in some cases, application failure)."

msgid "This same program in C would need to deal with APR's memory pool system. But Python handles memory usage automatically, and Subversion's Python bindings adhere to that convention. In C, you'd be working with custom datatypes (such as those provided by the APR library) for representing the hash of entries and the list of paths, but Python has hashes (called <quote>dictionaries</quote>) and lists as built-in datatypes, and provides a rich collection of functions for operating on those types. So SWIG (with the help of some customizations in Subversion's language bindings layer) takes care of mapping those custom datatypes into the native datatypes of the target language. This provides a more intuitive interface for users of that language."
msgstr "同样的C程序需要处理APR内存池系统，但是Python自己处理内存，Subversion的Python绑定也遵循这种习惯。在C语言中，为表示路径和条目的hash需要处理自定义的数据类型（例如APR提供的库），但是Python有hash（叫做<quote>dictionaries</quote>），并且是内置数据类型，而且还提供了一系列操作这些类型的函数，所以SWIG（通过Subversion的语言绑定层的自定义帮助）要小心的将这些自定义数据类型映射到目标语言的数据类型，这为目标语言的用户提供了一个更加直观的接口。"

Note that a released source package may not contain everything you need to build a command-line client capable of talking to a remote repository.

One remedy is to have a sysadmin (or other Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a working copy and manually set the <literal>svn:mime-type</literal> property on necessary files.

"      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\n"
"      all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n"
"      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly\n"
"      perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any\n"
"      technological measures that control access or use of the Work in\n"
"      a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License\n"
"      Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a\n"
"      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work\n"
"      apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n"
"      this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from\n"
"      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n"
"      the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the\n"
"      Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work,\n"

"      the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the\n"
"      medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or\n"
"      pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the\n"
"      title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably\n"
"      practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that\n"
"      Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\n"
"      URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n"
"      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work,\n"
"      a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work\n"
"      (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n"
"      \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such\n"
"      credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n"
"      however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective\n"
"      Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other\n"
"      comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as\n"
"      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n"
"\n"
"5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n"

"   APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n"
"   LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n"
"   OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n"
"   WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n"
"   DAMAGES.\n"
"\n"
"7. Termination\n"
"\n"
"   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n"
"      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n"
"      License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative\n"

"      will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n"
"      individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those\n"

"      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright\n"

"      right to release the Work under different license terms or to\n"
"      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that\n"
"      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or\n"
"      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n"
"      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue\n"
"      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n"

"      license granted to You under this License.\n"
"\n"
"   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n"
"      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n"
"      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,\n"
"      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,\n"
"      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary\n"
"      to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n"
"\n"
"   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and\n"
"      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n"
