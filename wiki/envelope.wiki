#summary 来自 TP 协调员的回信

== 说 明 ==
把回信放这里，不是说我们不要翻译质量了。质量是要的，但也是要每个人量力而行的。当我们已经求过翻译软件，仔细看过 wikipedia，但还是无解时。“质量”的定义，老外给了我们一个好的解释。

 >  And I'm sorry for making slow progress in sending to tp-robot. In fact, I've done all what I occupied and no errors output. But I think they should be well checked by someone else for chinese users, because I'm not a bachelor relevant to computer.



It's a good idea to upload files to the robot *as soon as you
yourself are content with them*.  You can always send in a corrected
version of a PO file later if during review someone finds a mistake
or there is simply something you would like to change.  The robot
doesn't mind, and the *upstream maintainer won't mind a few messages
extra when these mean that people are actively working on the
translations*.  So... *better* send them in soon than miss the next
release of a package.  :)
